<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><i>This book, originally published as a Life of the Prince of Wales,
has now been much enlarged and brought up to the latest date,
including His Majesty’s Accession and the events which followed.
Fresh illustrations have also been added. It is believed that
no previous attempt has been made to present a connected
account of the Kings life, although isolated portions of His
Majesty’s manifold activities have been treated of by various
writers. Thus the author of the present work acknowledges
considerable indebtedness to the Honble. Mrs. Grey’s “Journal of
a Visit to Egypt, Constantinople, the Crimea, Greece, etc., in the
Suite of the Prince and Princess of Wales”; to Sir W. H.
Russell’s delightful volumes on their Majesties’ tour in the East
and the King’s tour in India (from which two illustrations are
reproduced); and to Sir H. C. Burdett’s “Prince, Princess, and
People,” which deals mainly with the philanthropic work of the
King and Queen. A large number of memoirs have also been
consulted, including those of the Prince Consort, the Duchess of
Teck, Baron Stockmar, Archbishop Magee, Archbishop Benson,
Dean Stanley, and Canon Kingsley.</i></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">AN APPRECIATION</span></h2>

<p>On the Sunday following that eventful 9th of November on
which His Most Gracious Majesty King Edward VII. first
saw the light, the Rev. Sydney Smith preached at St. Paul’s,
and made the following interesting addition to the Bidding
Prayer:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We pray also for that infant of the Royal race whom in
Thy good providence Thou hast given us for our future King.
We beseech Thee so to mould his heart and fashion his spirit
that he may be a blessing and not an evil to the land of his
birth. May he grow in favour with man by leaving to its
own force and direction the energy of a free people. May he
grow in favour with God by holding the faith in Christ
fervently and feelingly, without feebleness, without fanaticism,
without folly. As he will be the first man in these realms,
so may he be the best, disdaining to hide bad actions by high
station, and endeavouring always by the example of a strict
and moral life to repay those gifts which a loyal people are so
willing to spare from their own necessities to a good King.”</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this prayer was uttered in
1841, and some of the phrases which the great wit used
reflect rather the Holland House view of the monarchy
entertained at that time. Nevertheless, the prayer is noteworthy
because in spirit, if not in the letter, it has been so
completely answered. The manner of King Edward’s
accession exhibits to a contemplative mind the eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
contrast between East and West. In an Oriental State a
new Sovereign is as a rule unknown even in his outward
appearance to his subjects, and is generally tossed up on to
the throne by the angry waves of some palace intrigue of
which he himself knows nothing. But it is the peculiar
happiness of the British people that, in the midst of their
bitter grief at the loss of Queen Victoria, there came to them
the swift thought that one whom they had known and approved
from his youth up was her successor, and would assuredly
walk in her footsteps.</p>

<p>The accession of a Prince so universally beloved to the
throne of his ancestors amid the deeply-felt joy of a great and
free people is an inspiring spectacle. Perhaps, however, it is
not fully realised how much King Edward, in the years of his
public life as Prince of Wales, shared in the duties of the
British Crown. The following pages will, it is hoped, show
how completely His Majesty and his lamented mother agreed
in their conception of the position of ruler of the British
Empire. It is known that the death of the Prince Consort
drew even closer the ties of affection which subsisted between
the late Sovereign and her eldest son, and it would seem as
if King Edward from that day forward had set both his
parents before himself as exemplars, and had endeavoured to
approve himself to his future subjects as a worthy son, not
only of Victoria the Wise but also of Albert the Good. It is
certainly significant how many of the qualities of both his
parents His Majesty possesses.</p>

<p>In those admirable messages to his people, and to India
and the Colonies, as well as to his Navy and Army, the King
wrote absolutely as his mother would have wished him to
write. There is in these documents the same keen personal
sympathy, the same human touch, so notable in all Her late
Majesty’s letters to her people, the same unerring perception,
the same insight which demonstrated how completely the heart
of the monarch was beating in unison with that of his people.</p>

<p>Although the British people realised and appreciated the
Prince Consort’s great qualities some time before his death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
it is, nevertheless, true to say that they never came to regard
him with quite the same feeling of affection as that in which
other members of the Royal Family were held. This was in
no sense the fault of Prince Albert, but is rather attributable
to that national prejudice against everything and everybody
not originally and completely British which was especially
strong in the middle years of the nineteenth century. Certainly
we have become more cosmopolitan since those days; we
have come to see that the manners and customs of foreign
nations are not perhaps always so absurd as our forefathers,
at any rate, supposed, and may even in some few respects be
worthy of adoption and imitation.</p>

<p>In this salutary process of national illumination King
Edward VII. undoubtedly played a considerable part. From
the beginning of his public career he endeared himself to his
future subjects by his natural <i>bonhomie</i>, his tact, and a certain
indefinable touch of human sympathy which characterised all
his actions and speeches. He was therefore able to carry on
and to develop with extraordinary success his father’s work
in promoting, not only the higher pursuits of science and art,
but also the more immediately practical application of scientific
principles to industries and manufactures. Few people realise
how much England’s industrial prosperity was advanced both
by the father and the son, and how much greater that prosperity
would have been if Prince Albert’s foresight had been better
understood and appreciated by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Prince Albert will also ever be remembered with gratitude
by the British people for the unremitting care which he devoted
to the education of all his children, and especially to that of
his eldest son. Of course the seed must be sown in good
ground, and we know that the ground was good; the effect
of that early education is seen in the admirable tact with
which King Edward filled a most difficult and delicate position
for many years. This position was rendered additionally
onerous by the sometimes ridiculous, sometimes malevolent,
stories which used to be circulated about his private affairs.
It is one of the great penalties of Royalty that practically no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
reply can be made to the voice of calumny and detraction.
The increase of the means of communication, and the growth
of the newspaper press, have tended to heighten the glare of
publicity in which Royalty is compelled to live. But this
bright light of publicity does not at all resemble that dry
light of reason which Bacon regarded as so essential to the
investigations of science; its rays are refracted and distorted
by ignorance and clumsiness, if not by actual malevolence.
Mr. Balfour’s quiet announcement in the House of Commons
soon after the King’s Accession, that on the resettlement of the
Civil List no question of debts will arise for consideration&mdash;as
was the case, for instance, on the Accession of George IV.&mdash;is
an impressive reply to rumours regrettably current of late years.</p>

<p>It must have required no common discipline and self-control
to bear such penalties as those, inflicted by the
tongue of scandal, and at the same time to exercise that
invariable discretion in reference to the great interests of
State which we all admired so much in His Majesty when
he was Prince of Wales. We should all regard as extraordinary,
were it not that we have become so used to it, the
way in which His Majesty contrived over so many years to
be in politics and yet not of them; to educate himself in State
affairs, while preserving that rigorous impartiality which our
constitutional monarchy demands from the Heir to the throne.
The sentiments with which he takes up his great task as King,
not only of the United Kingdom but also of our vast Colonial
Empire beyond the seas, added to the great dependency of
India, is significantly shown in a sentence which His Majesty
uttered in a speech long ago&mdash;that his great wish was that
every man born in the Colonies should feel himself as English
as if he had been born in Kent or Sussex.</p>

<span class="smaller">BIRTH AND EARLY YEARS</span></h2>

<p>King Edward VII. was born on 9th November 1841, at Buckingham
Palace. The Duke of Wellington, who was in the
Palace at the time, is said to have asked the nurse, Mrs. Lily,
“Is it a boy?” “It’s a <i>Prince</i>, your Grace,” answered the
justly offended woman.</p>

<p>The news was received with great enthusiasm throughout
the country, and Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had
thousands of letters and telegrams of congratulation not only
through official sources at home and abroad but from many of
Her Majesty’s humblest subjects all over the world. <i>Punch</i>
celebrated the event in some verses beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Huzza! we’ve a little Prince at last,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A roaring Royal boy;</div>
<div class="verse">And all day long the booming bells</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Have rung their peals of joy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And the little park guns have blazed away,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And made a tremendous noise,</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst the air has been filled since eleven o’clock</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With the shouts of little boys.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the moment of his birth the eldest son of the Sovereign
became Duke of Cornwall. This dukedom was the first created
in England. It was created by King Edward III. by charter,
wherein his son, Edward the Black Prince, was declared Duke
of Cornwall, to hold to himself and his heirs, Kings of England,
and to their first-born sons; and it is in virtue of that charter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that the eldest son of the Sovereign is by law acknowledged
Duke of Cornwall the instant he is born.</p>

<p>At the same time King Edward III. granted by patent
certain provision for the support of the dukedom, including the
Stannaries, in Cornwall, together with the coinage of tin, and
various lands, manors, and tenements, some of which lay outside
the county of Cornwall, but were nevertheless deemed to be
part of the duchy. From these rents and royalties King
Edward VII. derived, when he was Duke of Cornwall, a revenue
of about £60,000 a year.</p>

<p>The little prince also became at his birth Duke of Rothesay,
Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Great
Steward of Scotland (by act of the Scottish Parliament in 1469),
but he was not born Prince of Wales. King George IV. was
only a week old when he was created Prince of Wales and Earl
of Chester by letters patent, but King Edward VII. had to
wait nearly a month&mdash;till 4th December 1841&mdash;for these
dignities.</p>

<p>The picturesque origin of the title of Prince of Wales is
well known&mdash;how King Edward I. promised the turbulent
Welsh barons to appoint them a prince of their own, one who
was born in Wales and could not speak a word of English,
and on whose life and conversation there was no stain at all.
Having engaged the consent of the barons beforehand, he
showed them his infant son, Prince Edward, who had been
born in Carnarvon Castle but a few days before, and who was
thereupon acclaimed as the first Prince of Wales. The dignity
thus became established as personal, not hereditary, which
could be granted or withheld at the pleasure of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>The Earldom of Chester was an early creation which was
annexed to the Crown for ever by letters patent in the thirty-first
year of King Henry III., when Prince Edward, his eldest
son, was immediately granted the dignity. Edward the Black
Prince received the Earldom of Chester when he was only
three years old, before he was created Duke of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria’s recovery was rapid, as will be seen from
the following entry in Her Majesty’s <i>Journal</i> on 21st November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the birthday of the Empress Frederick (Princess Royal of
England):&mdash;</p>

<p>“Albert brought in dearest little Pussy [the Princess
Royal] in such a smart white merino dress trimmed with
blue, which Mama [the Duchess of Kent] had given her,
and a pretty cap, and placed her on my bed, seating himself
next to her, and she was very dear and good. And as my
precious, invaluable Albert sat there, and our little Love
between us, I felt quite moved with happiness and gratitude
to God.”</p>

<p>A little less than a month after the birth of her eldest son,
Queen Victoria wrote to her uncle, Leopold I., King of the
Belgians:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I wonder very much who my little boy will be like. You
will understand <i>how</i> fervent are my prayers, and I am sure
everybody’s must be, to see him resemble his Father in <i>every,
every</i> respect, both in body and mind.”</p>

<p>Christmas with its Christmas tree brought a new fund of
delight to the Royal parents. “To think,” wrote the Queen
in her <i>Journal</i>, “that we have two children now, and one who
enjoys the sight already, is like a dream!” Prince Albert also
wrote to his father:&mdash;“To-day I have two children of my own
to give presents to, who, they know not why, are full of happy
wonder at the German Christmas tree and its radiant candles.”</p>

<p>The christening of the Prince of Wales took place on 25th
January 1842, in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, for although
Royal baptisms had hitherto been celebrated within the Palace,
both the Queen and Prince Albert felt it to be more in
harmony with the religious sentiments of the country that the
future King should be christened within a consecrated building.</p>

<p>As can be easily understood, the choice of sponsors for the
Prince of Wales was a matter of considerable delicacy. Finally
the King of Prussia was asked to undertake the office, and Baron
Stockmar gives the following interesting account of how His
Majesty brushed aside the intrigues which were immediately
set on foot:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Politicians, as their habit is, attached an exaggerated
political importance to the affair. The King, who foresaw
this, wrote to Metternich, and in a manner asked for his
advice. The answer was evasive; and on this the King determined
not to give himself any concern about the political
intrigues which were set on foot against the journey. Certain
it is, that the Russians, Austrians, and even the French, in the
person of Bresson (their Ambassador at Berlin) manœuvred
against it. They were backed up by a Court party, who were
persuaded that the King would avail himself of the opportunity
to promote, along with Bunsen and the Archbishop of Canterbury,
his pet idea of Anglicanizing the Prussian Church.
When the King’s decision to go became known, Bresson
begged that he would at least go through France, and give
the Royal Family a meeting; but this was declined.”</p>

<p>The King of Prussia arrived on the 22nd, and was met by
Prince Albert at Greenwich and conducted to Windsor.</p>

<p>King Edward’s other sponsors were his step-grandmother, the
Duchess of Saxe-Coburg, represented by the Duchess of Kent;
the Duke of Cambridge; the young Duchess of Saxe-Coburg
(Queen Victoria’s sister-in-law), represented by the Duchess
of Cambridge; Princess Sophia, represented by the Princess
Augusta of Cambridge; and Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg.</p>

<p>Nothing was omitted to make the Prince of Wales’s christening
a magnificent and impressive ceremony. There was a full
choral service, and a special anthem had been composed by Mr.
(afterwards Sir) George Elvey for the occasion. When Prince
Albert was told of this, and asked when it should be sung, he
answered, “Not at all. No anthem. If the service ends by
an anthem, we shall all go out criticising the music. We will
have something we all know&mdash;something in which we can all
join&mdash;something devotional. The Hallelujah Chorus; we
shall all join in that, with our hearts.” The Hallelujah Chorus
ended the ceremony accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Christening of King Edward VII.</span></p>

<p><i>From the Painting by Sir George Hayter</i></p>

</div>

<p>“It is impossible,” wrote Queen Victoria in her <i>Journal</i>,
“to describe how beautiful and imposing the effect of the whole
scene was in the fine old chapel, with the banners, the music,
and the light shining on the altar.” It was significant of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
young Queen’s native simplicity that the Prince was only
christened Albert, after his father, and Edward, after his
grandfather, the Duke of Kent.</p>

<p>Both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert soon showed that
they were determined to allow nothing like publicity to come
near their nurseries, and the public obtained but few glimpses
of the Prince of Wales as a child. Prince Albert’s intimate
friend and adviser, Baron Stockmar, wrote a year after his
birth to one of his friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Prince, although a little plagued with his teeth, is
strong upon his legs, with a calm, clear, bright expression of
face.” Before he was eighteen months old His Royal Highness
had already sat for his portrait several times.</p>

<p>King Edward VII. was barely four months old when Baron
Stockmar drew up a very long memorandum on the education
of the Royal children. In this document he laid down that
the beginning of education must be directed to the regulation
of the child’s natural instincts, to give them the right direction,
and above all to keep the mind pure. “This,” he went on,
“is only to be effected by placing about children only those
who are good and pure, who will teach not only by precept
but by living example, for children are close observers, and
prone to imitate whatever they see or hear, whether good
or evil.” In the frankest manner the shrewd old German
physician proceeded to point out that the irregularities of
three of George III.’s sons&mdash;George IV., the Duke of York,
and William IV.&mdash;had weakened the respect and influence of
Royalty in this country, although the nation ultimately forgave
them, because, “whatever the faults of those Princes were,
<i>they were considered by the public as true English faults</i>”;
whereas the faults of some of their brothers, who had been
brought up on the Continent, though not at all worse, were
not condoned, owing to the power of national prejudice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Victoria, the Empress Frederick, and King Edward VII.</span></p>

<p><i>From the Painting by S. Cousins, A.R.A.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The conclusion at which Baron Stockmar consequently
arrived was, “that the education of the Royal infants ought
to be from its earliest beginning <i>a truly moral and a truly
English one</i>.” It ought therefore to be entrusted from the
beginning only to persons who were themselves morally good,
intelligent, well informed, and experienced, who should enjoy
the full and implicit confidence of the Royal parents. The
Baron did not mince matters with regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> “the malignant
insinuations, cavillings, and calumnies of ignorant or intriguing
people, who are more or less to be found at every Court, and who
invariably try to destroy the parents’ confidence in the tutor.”</p>

<p>These principles commended themselves to Queen Victoria
and Prince Albert, and Her Majesty wrote the following
interesting letter to Lord Melbourne on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>24th March 1842</i>.</p>

<p>“We are much occupied in considering the future management
of our nursery establishment, and naturally find considerable
difficulties in it. As one of the Queen’s kindest
and most impartial friends, the Queen wishes to have Lord
Melbourne’s opinion upon it. The present system will not do,
and must be changed; and now how it is to be arranged is
the great question and difficulty.… Stockmar says, and
very justly, that our occupations prevent us from managing
these affairs as much our own selves as other parents can,
and therefore that we must have some one in whom to place
<i>implicit confidence</i>. He says, a lady of rank and title with a
sub-governess would be the best. But where to find a person
so situated, fit for the place, and, if fit, one who will consent
to shut herself up in the nursery, and entirely from society, as
she must, if she is <i>really</i> to superintend the whole, and not
accept the office, as in my case, Princess Charlotte’s, and my
aunts’, merely for title, which would be only a source of annoyance
and dispute?</p>

<p>“My fear is, that even if such a woman were to be found,
she would consider herself not as only responsible to the
Prince and Queen, but more to the country, and nation, and
public, and I feel she ought to be responsible only to <i>us</i>,
and <i>we</i> to the country and nation. A person of less high
rank, the Queen thinks, would be less likely to do that, but
would wish to be responsible only to the parents. Naturally,
too, we are anxious to have the education as simple and
domestic as possible. Then again, a person of lower rank is
less likely to be looked up to and obeyed, than one of some
name and rank. What does Lord Melbourne think?”</p>

<p>In his reply Lord Melbourne fully concurred in Baron
Stockmar’s suggestion that a lady of rank should be appointed,
and the choice of the Royal parents fell upon Lady Lyttelton,
who had been a lady-in-waiting from 1838, and who appeared
to possess the precise qualifications which the post demanded.
The daughter of George John, second Earl Spencer, and his
wife Lavinia, daughter of the first Earl of Lucan, she was born
in 1787, married, in 1813, William Henry, afterwards third
Lord Lyttelton, and died in 1870. Lady Lyttelton was
installed as governess to the Royal children in April 1842,
and discharged her duties with equal ability and devotion.
Early in 1851 she laid down her office. Her young charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
parted from her with sad hearts and tearful eyes, as Sir
Theodore Martin records in the <i>Life of the Prince Consort</i>,
while from the Queen and Prince Albert she received marked
proofs of the deep gratitude which they felt for all that she had
done.</p>

<p>In 1846 King Edward accompanied his parents on two
yachting excursions, in August and September, on board the
Royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>. Writing in her <i>Journal</i>
on 2nd September, Queen Victoria says, with a pretty touch
of maternal pride:&mdash;</p>

<p>“After passing the Alderney Race it became quite smooth;
and then Bertie put on his sailor’s dress, which was beautifully
made by the man on board who makes for our sailors. When
he appeared, the officers and sailors, who were all assembled
on deck to see him, cheered, and seemed delighted with him.”</p>

<p>Then, when the yacht arrived at Mounts Bay, Cornwall,
Her Majesty records on 5th September that “when Bertie
showed himself the people shouted ‘Three cheers for the
Duke of Cornwall.’”</p>

<p>Again, at Falmouth, on 7th September, the Queen says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Corporation of Penryn were on board, and very
anxious to see ‘The Duke of Cornwall,’ so I stepped out of
the pavilion on deck with Bertie, and Lord Palmerston told
them that that was ‘The Duke of Cornwall’; and the old
Mayor of Penryn said that ‘he hoped he would grow up a
blessing to his parents and to his country.’”</p>

<p>At Sunny Corner, just below Truro, the whole population
“cheered, and were enchanted when Bertie was held up for
them to see. It was a very pretty, gratifying sight.”</p>

<p>Princess Mary of Cambridge, afterwards the much-loved
and lamented Duchess of Teck, gives a delightful picture of
the Royal children in a letter written in 1847 to Miss Draper,
her governess. Princess Mary was then about fourteen, and
King Edward was rather more than five years old:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>“We paid a visit to the Queen at Windsor on New Year’s
Eve, and left there on the 2nd. The Queen gave me a bracelet
with her hair, and was very kind to me. The little Royal
children are sweet darlings; the Princess Royal is my pet,
because she is remarkably clever. The Prince of Wales is a
very pretty boy, but he does not talk as much as his sister.
Little Alfred, the fourth child, is a beautiful fatty, with lovely
hair. Alice is rather older than him; she is very modest and
quiet, but very good-natured. Helena, the baby, is a very fine
child, and very healthy, which, however, they all are.”</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by W. Hensel, in the possession of the German Emperor</i></p>

</div>

<p>In August 1847, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, with
the Queen’s half-brother, the Prince of Leiningen, went for
a tour round the west coast of Scotland, taking with them
their two eldest children, the Prince of Wales and the Princess
Royal. This is notable as King Edward’s first visit to Scotland,
for he was too young to accompany his parents on their
first tour in Scotland in 1842; while when the Queen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Prince Albert visited Blair-Atholl in 1844 they only took with
them the little Princess Royal.</p>

<p>Of this tour round the west coast of Scotland we obtain
some delightful details in the late Queen’s <i>Leaves from the
Journal of Our Life in the Highlands</i>. The Royal party started
from Osborne in the Royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, and they
took the opportunity, after leaving Dartmouth, of visiting the
Scilly Islands. The Queen writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Albert (who, as well as Charles, has not been unwell, while
I suffered very much) went with Charles and Bertie to see one
of the islands. The children recover from their sea-sickness
directly.” By “Charles,” it should be explained, is meant the
Prince of Leiningen. Naturally, when the Royal yacht arrived
in Welsh waters, there was the greatest enthusiasm among
the inhabitants at the sight of their little Prince. It must be
remembered that at that time practically nothing was known
by the general public about the Royal children, for their parents
had very wisely resolved that they should as far as possible
enjoy a natural, happy childhood, that being the best possible
preparation for the public life that awaited them. However,
evidently no harm was done by the notice which was taken
of the Royal children on this tour. At Milford Haven their
loving mother writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Numbers of boats came out, with Welshwomen in their
curious high-crowned men’s hats, and Bertie was much cheered,
for the people seemed greatly pleased to see the ‘Prince of
Wales.’” Then again at Rothesay, when the yacht had passed
up the Clyde:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The children enjoy everything extremely, and bear the
novelty and excitement wonderfully. The people cheered the
‘Duke of Rothesay’ very much, and also called for a cheer for
the ‘Princess of Great Britain.’ Everywhere the good Highlanders
are very enthusiastic.”</p>

<p>With regard to her son’s title of Duke of Rothesay, Queen
Victoria appends the following interesting note:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>“A title belonging to the eldest son of the Sovereign of
Scotland, and therefore held by the Prince of Wales as eldest
son of the Queen, the representative of the ancient Kings of
Scotland.”</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by Winterhalter</i></p>

</div>

<p>At Inveraray, which was next visited, the little Prince first
met his future brother-in-law, the Marquis of Lorne, whom the
Queen describes, in words which have often been quoted but
will bear repetition, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> “just two years old, a dear, white, fat,
fair little fellow with reddish hair, but very delicate features,
like both his father and mother: he is such a merry, independent
little child. He had a black velvet dress and
jacket, with a ‘sporran,’ scarf, and Highland bonnet.”</p>

<p>Naturally a good deal of interest was taken in the little
Prince of Wales by those who had an opportunity of seeing
him. When the great geologist, Sir Charles Lyell, went to
Balmoral, the Queen’s eldest son, “a pleasing, lively boy,”
gave him an account of the conjuring of Anderson, the
“Wizard of the North,” who had just then shown the Court
some marvellous tricks. Said the Prince in an awestruck
tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>“He cut to pieces Mamma’s pocket-handkerchief, then
darned it and ironed it so that it was as entire as ever; he then
fired a pistol, and caused five or six watches to go through
Gibbs’s head; but Papa knows how all these things are done,
and had the watches really gone through Gibbs’s head he
could hardly have looked so well, though he was confounded.”</p>

<p>Gibbs, it should be mentioned, was a footman.</p>

<p>The late Archbishop Benson, before he went up to Cambridge,
was tutor to the sons of Mr. Wicksted, then tenant of
Abergeldie Castle. Writing to his mother on 15th September
1848, young Mr. Benson gives the following interesting description
of a glimpse which he had of the King as a little boy:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Prince of Wales is a fair little lad, rather of slender
make, with a good head and a remarkably quiet and thinking
face, above his years in intelligence I should think. The
sailor portrait of him is a good one, but does not express the
thought that there is on his little brow. Prince Alfred is a fair,
chubby little lad, with a quiet look, but quite the Guelph face,
which does not appear in the Prince of Wales.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Landing of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and their Children
at Aberdeen</span></p>

<p><i>From a Painting by Cleland</i></p>

</div>

<p>In September 1848 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
established themselves with their six children at Balmoral,
and Her Majesty records her first impressions of the place
which was to be for so many years her much-loved Northern
home. After describing her own and Prince Albert’s rooms,
she says, “Opposite, down a few steps, are the children’s and
Miss Hildyard’s three rooms.” Only a few days later we hear
of the little Prince of Wales going out with his parents for a
“drive” in the Balloch Buie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> “We then mounted our ponies,
Bertie riding Grant’s pony on the deer-saddle, and being led
by a gillie, Grant walking by his side.” Grant, it should be
explained, was head keeper, and much trusted by the Queen
and Prince Albert, and for him was built a pretty lodge called
Croft, a mile from Balmoral. “We scrambled up an almost
perpendicular place to where there was a little <i>box</i>, made of
hurdles and interwoven with branches of fir and heather, about
five feet in height. There we seated ourselves with Bertie.”
It can readily be imagined with what excitement the little
Prince waited for nearly an hour till his father obtained a shot.
The Queen records how her son helped her over the rough
ground until they all gathered round the magnificent “Royal”
which had fallen to Prince Albert’s gun.</p>

<p>The life at Balmoral was as far as possible shorn of Royal
state, and was much the same, no doubt, as that which was
led under many another hospitable roof-tree in the country
round about. Queen Victoria devoted herself to her husband
and children. Thus she records, on 11th September 1849,
“The morning was very fine. I heard the children repeat
some poetry in German.”</p>

<p>The life at Windsor Castle was scarcely less simple.
Writing to an intimate friend, the late Duchess of Teck thus
describes a dramatic performance at the Castle in January
1849, in which King Edward appeared, in spite of an accident
which he had had a few days before:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>“Last Wednesday we went to Windsor Castle to remain
till Friday. The visit went off very well indeed. The Queen
and the children are looking very well, and the latter much
grown. The poor little Prince of Wales has disfigured his
face by falling on an iron-barred gate, and the bridge of his
nose and both his eyes are quite black and bruised, but
fortunately no bones were broken. The first evening we
danced till twelve o’clock. Next day, … dinner was very
early, and at eight o’clock the Play began. ‘Used Up’ and
‘Box and Cox’ were chosen for that night, and I was much
pleased at seeing two very amusing pieces. They were very
well acted, and we all laughed a great deal. The Theatre
was well arranged, and the decorations and lamps quite
wonderfully managed. It was put up in the Rubens-room,
which is separated from the Garter-room by one small room
where the Private Band stood. In the Garter-room was the
Buffet, and in the centre hung one of the beautiful chandeliers
from the pavilion at Brighton. The four elder children
appeared at the Play, and the two boys wore their ‘kilts.’
The two little girls had on white lace gowns, over white
satin, with pink bows and sashes. Princess Royal wears her
hair in a very becoming manner, all twisted up into a large
curl, which is tucked into a dark blue or black silk net, which
keeps it all very tidy and neat.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE KING’S BOYHOOD</span></h2>

<p>In view of all that has been said in the last chapter to show
how anxiously Queen Victoria and Prince Albert considered
the education of the future King of England, it is amusing to
record that the latter was quite five years old before it occurred
to the public to take an interest in the question. It was
then that a pamphlet was published, entitled <i>Who should educate
the Prince of Wales?</i> This contribution to the subject was
carefully read by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and Baron
Stockmar drew up another long memorandum, dealing this
time with the question of the Prince’s education alone. He was
fully sensible of the importance of the subject.</p>

<p>“On the choice of the principles on which the Prince of
Wales shall be educated,” he wrote, “will in all probability
depend whether the future Sovereign of England shall reign
in harmony with, or in opposition to, the prevailing opinions
of his people. The importance of the selection of principles
is increased by the consideration that opinion in Europe is at
this moment obviously in a state of transition, and that by
the time the Prince shall ascend the throne many of the maxims
of government and institutions of society now in the ascendancy
will, according to present probabilities, have either entirely
passed away, or be on the very verge of change.”</p>

<p>After enlarging on this topic, the Baron lays down that the
great and leading question is&mdash;whether the education of the
Prince should be one which will prepare him for approaching
events, or one which will stamp, perhaps indelibly, an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the sacred character of all existing institutions on
his youthful mind, and teach him that to resist change is to
serve at once the cause of God and of his country. Baron
Stockmar recommends the former course, but he utters the
warning that:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The education of the Prince should, however, nowise tend
to make him a demagogue or a moral enthusiast, but a man
of calm, profound, comprehensive understanding, imbued with
a deep conviction of the indispensable necessity of practical
morality to the welfare of both Sovereign and people. The
proper duty of the Sovereign in this country is not to take
the lead in change, but to act as a balance-wheel on the movements
of the social body. When the whole nation, or a large
majority of it, advances, the King should not stand still; but
when the movement is too partial, irregular, or over-rapid, the
royal power may with advantage be interposed to restore the
equilibrium. Above all attainments, the Prince should be
trained to freedom of thought and a firm reliance on the
inherent power of sound principles, political, moral, and religious,
to sustain themselves and produce practical good when left in
possession of a fair field of development.”</p>

<p>As regards the religious faith in which the future King
was to be brought up, the law prescribed that of the Church
of England, and Baron Stockmar therefore does not discuss
that point, but he does put a question arising out of it, which
naturally seemed in that year&mdash;1846&mdash;more difficult than it
would seem nowadays. The Baron asks in effect whether
the Prince should be made acquainted with the changes then
going on in public opinion in regard to matters of faith, and
the important influence on the minds of educated men which
the discoveries of science were likely to exert in the future?
Without suggesting a definite answer to his own question, the
Baron goes on to say:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Prince should early be taught that thrones and
social order have a stable foundation in the moral and
intellectual faculties of man; that by addressing his public
exertions to the cultivation of these powers in his people,
and by taking their dictates as the constant guides of his
own conduct, he will promote the solidity of his empire and
the prosperity of his subjects. In one word, he should be
taught that God, in the constitution of the mind and in
the arrangement of creation, has already legislated for men,
both as individuals and as nations; that the laws of morality,
which he has written in their nature, are the foundations on
which, and on which alone, their prosperity can be reared;
and that the human legislator and sovereign have no higher
duty than to discover and carry into execution these enactments
of Divine legislation.”</p>

<p>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert also consulted the
Bishop of Oxford (Dr. Wilberforce) and Sir James Clark,
both of whom recorded their views in long and carefully
considered papers, in which they came to conclusions substantially
the same as those of Baron Stockmar. On these
principles, therefore, King Edward VII. was educated, namely,
that the best way to build up a noble and princely character
was to bring it into intelligent sympathy with the best movements
of the age.</p>

<p>After some further discussion Prince Albert opened
negotiations with Mr. Henry Birch, afterwards rector of
Prestwich, near Manchester, the gentleman who was ultimately
entrusted with the responsible position of tutor to the future
ruler of the British Empire. This young man had been
educated at Eton, where he had been captain of the school
and obtained the Newcastle medal. He had taken high
honours at Cambridge, and had then gone back to Eton as
an assistant master.</p>

<p>The Prince Consort had an interview with Mr. Birch in
August 1848, and says in a letter to Lord Morpeth, “The
impression he has left upon me is a very favourable one,
and I can imagine that children will easily attach themselves
to him.” Writing to his stepmother, the Dowager Duchess
of Gotha, in April 1849, Prince Albert observed:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>“Bertie will be given over in a few weeks into the hands
of a tutor, whom we have found in a Mr. Birch, a young,
good-looking, amiable man, who was a tutor at Eton, and
who not only himself took the highest honours at Cambridge,
but whose pupils have also won especial distinction. It is
an important step, and God’s blessing be upon it, for upon
the good education of Princes, and especially of those who
are destined to govern, the welfare of the world in these days
very greatly depends.”</p>

<p>During the years 1848 to 1850 a Mr. George Bartley, well
known at that time as an actor, was engaged to read at
Buckingham Palace translations of the <i>Antigone</i> and the trilogy
of <i>Œdipus</i>. Queen Victoria was so much pleased with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ability which Mr. Bartley showed that she engaged him to give
lessons in elocution to her eldest son, who certainly profited by
them, to judge by the ability which His Majesty afterwards
showed as a public speaker.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1849 King Edward VII. visited Ireland
for the first time. He landed with his parents at Queenstown,
and received a splendid welcome, which probably laid the
foundation of his hearty sympathy with and liking for the Irish
character. Queen Victoria, after vividly describing the enthusiasm
with which the Royal visitors were greeted at Dublin,
Cork, and elsewhere, writes in her <i>Journal</i> on 12th August:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I intend to create Bertie ‘Earl of Dublin,’ as a compliment
to the town and country; he has no Irish title, though he
is <i>born</i> with several Scotch ones (belonging to the heirs to the
Scotch throne, and which we have inherited from James VI. of
Scotland and I. of England); and this was one of my father’s
titles.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the Prince of Wales was soon afterwards
gazetted Earl of Dublin, but in the peerage of the United
Kingdom, not, as had been done in the case of the Duke of
Kent, in the peerage of Ireland.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that King Edward visited Ireland, and,
as we have seen, Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland, and made an
excellent impression upon the “Celtic fringe” before he was
brought before the public notice of his future English subjects.</p>

<p>He made his first official appearance in London on 30th
October 1849. It had been arranged that Queen Victoria was
to be present at the opening of the Coal Exchange, but she
was not able to go as she was suffering from chicken-pox.
Accordingly it was arranged that the Princess Royal and the
Prince of Wales should represent their Royal mother.</p>

<p>“Puss and the boy,” as the Queen called them, went with
their father in State from Westminster to the city in the Royal
barge rowed by twenty-six watermen. All London turned out
to meet the gallant little Prince and his pretty sister. Lady
Lyttelton, in a letter to Mrs. Gladstone, gives a charming
account of the event, and tells how the Prince Consort was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
careful to put the future King forward. Some city dignitary
addressed the young Prince as “the pledge and promise
of a long race of Kings,” and, says Lady Lyttelton, “poor
Princey did not seem to guess at all what he meant.” In
honour of the Royal children a great many quaint old city
customs were revived, including a swan barge, and both the
King and the Empress Frederick seem to have retained a very
delightful recollection of their first sight of the City.</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by Winterhalter</i></p>

</div>

<p>It must have been about this time that Miss Alcott, the
author of <i>Little Women</i>, paid a visit to London, and sent home
to her family the following description of the Prince:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>“A yellow-haired laddie, very like his mother. Fanny, W.,
and I nodded and waved as he passed, and he openly winked
his boyish eye at us, for Fanny with her yellow curls and wild
waving looked rather rowdy, and the poor little Prince wanted
some fun.”</p>

<p>Two years later the King was present at the opening of the
Great Exhibition of 1851, and in the following year Mr. Birch
retired from his responsible post, greatly to the sorrow of his
young pupil, who was a most affectionate and open-hearted
little boy.</p>

<p>In June 1852 Viscountess Canning wrote from Windsor
Castle:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Birch left yesterday. It has been a terrible sorrow
to the Prince of Wales, who has done no end of touching
things since he heard that he was to lose him three weeks ago.
He is such an affectionate, dear little boy; his little notes and
presents, which Mr. Birch used to find on his pillow, were
really too moving.”</p>

<p>As was natural, there were many discussions as to who
should become the Prince’s next tutor. On the recommendation
of Sir James Stephen, Mr. Frederick W. Gibbs was appointed.
He remained in his responsible position till 1858, and was rarely
separated from his Royal pupil during those seven years.</p>

<p>But although so much attention was devoted to the education
and mental training of the King, he spent a very happy
and unclouded childhood; and, like all his brothers and sisters,
he retained the happiest memories of the youthful days spent
by him at Balmoral, Osborne, and Windsor.</p>

<p>The Baroness Bunsen in her <i>Memoirs</i> gives a charming
account of a Masque devised by the Royal children in honour
of the anniversary of the Queen and the Prince Consort’s
marriage. King Edward, then twelve years old, represented
Winter. He wore a cloak covered with imitation icicles, and
recited some passages from Thomson’s <i>Seasons</i>. Princess Alice
was Spring, scattering flowers; the Princess Royal, Summer;
Prince Alfred, Autumn; while Princess Helena, in the <i>rôle</i>
of St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, who was, according
to tradition, a native of Britain, called down Heaven’s benedictions
on her much-loved parents.</p>

<p>Shortly before this pretty scene took place, King Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had made his first appearance in the House of Lords, sitting
beside his Royal mother upon the Throne. It was on this
occasion that the addresses of the two Houses in answer to
the Queen’s Message announcing the beginning of hostilities
in the Crimean War were presented, and there is no doubt
that the sad and terrible months that followed made a deep
and lasting impression on the King’s mind. He took the most
vivid interest in the fortune of the war, and in March 1855
went with his parents to the Military Hospital at Chatham,
where a large number of the wounded had recently arrived
from the East.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The popular concern was exhibited in many ingenious and
touching ways. An exhibition was held at Burlington House
in aid of the Patriotic Fund, and all the Royal children who
were old enough sent drawings and paintings, the King’s
exhibit obtaining the very considerable sum of 55 guineas.</p>

<p>The worst of the terrible struggle was over by the time
King Edward and the Empress Frederick accompanied their
parents to Paris in August of the same year. The visit was in
many ways historically eventful. Queen Victoria was the first
British Sovereign to enter Paris since the days of Henry VI.,
and the Royal Party received a truly splendid welcome. The
young Prince and his sister, however, were not allowed to be idle,
and, though they shared to a great extent in the entertainments
organised in honour of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort,
their headquarters remained the whole time in the charming
country palace of St. Cloud, and after sightseeing in Paris all
day, they were always driven back there each evening. It is
undoubtedly to the impression left by this visit that the King
owes his strong affection and liking for France and the French
people. When present at a splendid review, held in honour of
Queen Victoria, he attracted quite as much attention as any of
his elders, for he was dressed in full Highland costume, and
remained in the carriage with his mother and the Empress,
while the Emperor and Prince Consort were on horseback.</p>

<p>The British Royal party remained in France eight days.
The last gala given in their honour was a splendid ball at
Versailles, and on this occasion both the Prince of Wales and
the Princess Royal were allowed to be present, and sat down to
supper with the Emperor and Empress. A dance had not
been given at Versailles since the days of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>One of the most pleasing traits in Napoleon III.’s character
was his great liking for children. As was natural, he paid
considerable attention to his youthful guests, who both became
much attached to him; and later, when he was living at Chislehurst
a broken-hearted exile, King Edward never lost an
opportunity of paying him respectful and kindly attentions.
Indeed, the King enjoyed his first Continental holiday so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
heartily that he begged the Empress to get leave for his sister
and himself to stay a little longer after his parents were gone
home. When with some embarrassment she replied that
Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort would not be able to
do without their two children, he exclaimed, “Not do without
us! don’t fancy that, for there are six more of us at home, and
they don’t want <i>us</i>”; but it need hardly be added that this
naïve exclamation did not have the desired effect, and the
young people duly returned home with their parents.</p>

<p>A few days later, the Prince Consort, writing to Baron
Stockmar, observed: “You will be pleased to hear how well
both the children behaved. They made themselves general
favourites, especially the Prince of Wales, <i>qui est si gentil</i>.”
And on the same topic Prince Albert wrote to the Duchess of
Kent:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> “I am bound to praise the children greatly. They
behaved extremely well and pleased everybody. The task was

and with natural simplicity.”</p>

<p><i>After the Painting by Thorburn</i></p>

</div>

<p>When the King was fourteen he started on an <i>incognito</i>
walking tour in the West of England with Mr. Gibbs and
Colonel Cavendish. His father wrote to Baron Stockmar:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
“Bertie’s tour has hitherto gone off well and seems to interest
him greatly.” Then followed a short time spent in Germany,
as to which Prince Albert wrote to Baron Stockmar on 26th July,
1857: “Bertie set out to-day at noon for Königswinter&mdash;he
will take a week to get there. Of the young people only Lord
Derby’s son will go with him in the first instance; Wood,
Cadogan, and Gladstone will follow.”</p>

<p>This visit of the Prince of Wales to Königswinter was for
purposes of study, and he had with him General Grey, Colonel
(afterwards General) H. Ponsonby his domestic tutor, Mr.
Gibbs his classical tutor, the Rev. Charles Tarver (afterwards
Canon of Chester), and Dr. Armstrong. During the Prince’s
stay at Königswinter Mr. W. Gladstone, Mr. Charles Wood
(now Lord Halifax), the present Lord Cadogan, and the present
Lord Derby, then Mr. Frederick Stanley, were with him as
companions. It may be conveniently recorded here that in
1858, when Mr. F. W. Gibbs retired, Mr. Tarver was appointed
the Prince’s Director of Studies and Chaplain, in which capacity
he accompanied him to Rome, Spain, and Portugal, and then
went with him to Edinburgh, remaining with the Prince till the
autumn of 1859, when his education ceased to be conducted at
home.</p>

<p>The King was confirmed in 1858, and the Prince Consort,
writing to Baron Stockmar on 2nd April, gives an interesting
account of the ceremony:&mdash;</p>

<p>“They were all three [Lords Palmerston, John Russell, and
Derby] yesterday at the confirmation of the Prince of Wales,
which went off with great solemnity, and, I hope, with an
abiding impression on his mind. The previous day, his
examination took place before the Archbishop and ourselves.
Wellesley prolonged it to a full hour, and Bertie acquitted
himself <i>extremely well</i>.”</p>

<p>The day following his confirmation the King received the
sacrament with his father and mother, and here may be fittingly
ended the story of His Majesty’s boyhood.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">OXFORD, CAMBRIDGE, AND THE CURRAGH</span></h2>

<p>King Edward had now emerged from boyhood, and his loving
parents set themselves to make the arrangements suitable for
his growing years. What these arrangements were will be
clear from the following passages in the Prince Consort’s letter
to Baron Stockmar of 2nd April 1858:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Next week he [the Prince of Wales] is to make a run for
fourteen days to the South of Ireland with Mr. Gibbs, Captain
de Ros, and Dr. Minter, by way of recreation. When he returns
to London he is to take up his residence at the White Lodge
in Richmond Park, so as to be away from the world and devote
himself exclusively to study and prepare for a military examination.
As companions for him we have appointed three very
distinguished young men of from twenty-three to twenty-six
years of age, who are to occupy in monthly rotation a kind
of equerry’s place about him, and from whose more intimate
intercourse I anticipate no small benefit to Bertie. They are
Lord Valletort, the eldest son of Lord Mount Edgcumbe,
who has been much on the Continent, is a thoroughly good,
moral, and accomplished man, draws well and plays, and never
was at a public school, but passed his youth in attendance on
his invalid father; Major Teesdale, of the Artillery, who distinguished
himself greatly at Kars, where he was aide-de-camp
and factotum of Sir Fenwick Williams; Major Lindsay, of the
Scots Fusilier Guards, who received the Victoria Cross for
Alma and Inkermann (as Teesdale did for Kars), where he
carried the colours of the regiment, and by his courage drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
upon himself the attention of the whole Army. He is studious
in his habits, lives little with the other young officers, is fond
of study, familiar with French, and especially so with Italian,
spent a portion of his youth in Italy, won the first prize last
week under the regimental adjutant for the new rifle drill, and
resigned his excellent post as aide-de-camp of Sir James
Simpson, that he might be able to work as lieutenant in the
trenches.</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by G. Richmond</i></p>

</div>

<p>“Besides these three, only Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Tarver will
go with him to Richmond. As future governor, when Gibbs
retires at the beginning of next year, I have as yet been able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to think of no one as likely to suit, except Colonel Bruce, Lord
Elgin’s brother, and his military secretary in Canada, who now
commands one of the battalions of Grenadier Guards, and lives
much with his mother in Paris. He has all the amiability of
his sister, with great mildness of expression, and is full of
ability.”</p>

<p>Of these early companions of the King, Lord Valletort succeeded
to the Earldom of Mount Edgcumbe in 1861, Major
Teesdale was afterwards well known as Sir Christopher
Teesdale, while Major Lindsay was appointed extra equerry
to the Prince of Wales in 1874, and was created Lord Wantage
of Lockinge in 1885.</p>

<p>While the Prince of Wales was at White Lodge, where the
suite of rooms which he occupied still bears his name, he saw
much of his relations at Cambridge Cottage; he often rowed
up from Richmond or Mortlake, and mooring his boat alongside
the landing-stage at Brentford Ferry, would get out and take
a stroll in the gardens with his aunt and cousin. The first
dinner-party the Prince attended was at the Cottage on Kew
Green.</p>

<p>By Queen Victoria’s special desire, Charles Kingsley about
this time delivered a series of lectures on history to her eldest
son, and the Prince remained fondly attached to the famous
author of <i>Westward Ho</i>, who, till his death, was an honoured
guest at Sandringham and at Marlborough House.</p>

<p>On 9th November of the same year the King attained his
eighteenth year, and became legally heir to the Crown. Queen
Victoria wrote him a letter announcing his emancipation from
parental control, and he was so deeply touched by its perusal
that he brought it to General Wellesley with tears in his eyes,
and we have the impartial testimony of Charles Greville as to
the character of the epistle, which was, says the famous diarist,
“one of the most admirable letters that ever was penned.”
On the same day he became a Colonel in the Army (unattached),
and received the Garter, while Colonel Bruce became his
governor.</p>

<p>Exactly a month after his birthday, the King started on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Continental tour, travelling more or less <i>incognito</i> as Lord
Renfrew. He was accompanied by Mr. Tarver, who had just
been appointed his chaplain and director of studies. The King
stayed some time in Rome and visited the Pope, but on 29th
April 1859 the Prince Consort wrote to Baron Stockmar: “We
have sent orders to the Prince of Wales to leave Rome and to
repair to Gibraltar.” For it was very properly considered,
that owing to the Franco-Italian and Austrian imbroglio, it
was far better that the heir to the British throne should be
well out of the way of international dissensions.</p>

<p>The King reached Gibraltar on 7th May, and visited the
south of Spain and Lisbon, returning home in the middle of
the next month; and then, after having seen something of the
world, he again took up a very serious course of study, this
time at Edinburgh. Meanwhile the education and training
of the Heir-Apparent was being watched very carefully by the
British public, and a good many people began to consider that
their future King was being over-educated; indeed <i>Punch</i>, in
some lines entitled “A Prince at High Pressure,” undoubtedly
summed up the popular feeling, not only describing the past,
but prophesying, with a great deal of shrewd insight, the
future course of the Prince of Wales’s studies:&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Prince seems to have borne his course of study very
well, and after his son had been in Edinburgh some three
months the Prince Consort wrote to Baron Stockmar:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>“In Edinburgh I had an Educational Conference with all
the persons who were taking part in the education of the
Prince of Wales. They all speak highly of him, and he seems
to have shown zeal and goodwill. Dr. Lyon Playfair is giving
him lectures on chemistry in relation to manufactures, and at
the close of each special course he visits the appropriate manufactory
with him, so as to explain its practical application. Dr.
Schmitz (the Director of the High School of Edinburgh, a
German) gives him lectures on Roman history. Italian,
German, and French are advanced at the same time; and three
times a week the Prince exercises with the 16th Hussars, who
are stationed in the city. Mr. Fisher, who is to be the tutor
for Oxford, was also in Holyrood. Law and history are to
be the subjects on which he is to prepare the Prince.”</p>

<p>The young Prince spent a delightful holiday in the Highlands,
and made an expedition up Ben Muichdhui, one of the
highest mountains in Scotland. Then, on 9th November, his
nineteenth birthday was celebrated with the whole of his family,
for the Princess Royal had arrived from Berlin in order to
spend the day with her brother.</p>

<p>The King was at that time very fond of the writings of Sir
Walter Scott. He has always been a reader of fiction, French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
English, and German, and as a youth he was studious and
eager to learn.</p>

<p>On leaving Scotland he went up to Oxford, being admitted
a member of Christ Church. The Prince seems to have
thoroughly enjoyed his life as an undergraduate. He joined
freely in the social life of the University, and took part in all
the sports, frequently hunting with the South Oxfordshire
Hounds. Nor did he neglect his books, for we find the Prince
Consort writing to Baron Stockmar on 8th December 1859 to
say that, “The Prince of Wales is working hard at Oxford.”</p>

<p>It seems more convenient here to abandon the strictly
chronological arrangement, and to leave the Prince’s visit to
Canada and the United States, which followed immediately,
to be described in a separate chapter, passing on at once to
his life at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Early in 1861 the King became an undergraduate member of
Trinity College, Cambridge. Curiously enough, Dr. Whewell,
at that time Master of Trinity, did not think it necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
make a formal entry of the Royal undergraduate, but in 1883,
when visiting Cambridge in order to enter his son, the late
Duke of Clarence, as a student of Trinity, the King expressed
the opinion that it was a pity that his own entry had not been
properly filled up, and he offered to fill in the blank spaces if
the book was brought to him. Accordingly the record may
now be found at its proper place in the King’s own handwriting.
His entry is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The register entry" id="register">

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The entry immediately preceding the King’s name is that
of the Hon. J. W. Strutt (now Lord Rayleigh), in connection
with which the following amusing story is told. A visitor to
the library (where the book is kept) having expressed her
doubts as to the King’s intellectual abilities, the librarian
showed her the entry, and said: “You may be right in what
you say, madam, but allow me to inform you that the Prince
comes next to a former Senior Wrangler.” The lady’s astonishment
may be imagined, she being of course ignorant that
mere coincidence was the cause of the juxtaposition of the
two names.</p>

<p>The position of the Prince of Wales in the University was
very much that of an ordinary undergraduate, except in one
point&mdash;that he was, by special favour, allowed to live with his
governor, Colonel the Hon. Robert Bruce, about three miles
away from Cambridge, in a little village called Madingley.</p>

<p>Charles Kingsley at the Prince Consort’s request gave
some private lectures to the Prince of Wales. The class was
formed of eleven undergraduates, and after the Prince settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
at Madingley, he rode three times a week to Mr. Kingsley’s
house, twice attending with the class, and once to go through
a <i>résumé</i> of the week’s work alone; and, according to the great
writer’s biographer, the tutor much appreciated the attention,
courtesy, and intelligence of his Royal pupil, whose kindness
to him then and in after-life
made him not only the
Prince’s loyal but his most
attached servant.</p>

</div>

<p>The King certainly enjoyed
his life at Cambridge.
All sorts of stories, perhaps
more or less apocryphal, used
to be told as to his University
career. He was not
allowed quite as much freedom
as the ordinary undergraduate,
and Colonel Bruce
had strict orders never to
allow him to make any long
journeys unaccompanied. On
one occasion the King made
up his mind that he would
like to pay an <i>incognito</i> visit
to London, and he succeeded
in evading the vigilance of
those whose duty it was to
attend him. His absence, however, was discovered before he
could reach town, and to his surprise and mortification he was
met at the terminus by the stationmaster and by two of the
royal servants who had been sent from Buckingham Palace for
that purpose.</p>

<p>Shortly after his marriage the King took his bride to visit
Cambridge, and after the usual reception, the Royal pair drove
to Madingley, to view the King’s former residence. On reaching
one of the streets on the borders of the town it was found
to be barricaded, it being thought that the carriage would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
proceed by another route. “This is the way I always came,”
said the King, “and this is the way I wish to go now.” Forthwith
the sightseers were removed and the barricade broken
down, but the King signified his intention of returning by the
other road so that the spectators might not be disappointed.</p>

<p>The King remained more or less constantly at Cambridge
all the winter of 1861, and it was arranged that during the long
vacation he was to go on military duty at the Curragh.</p>

<p>While the King was quartered there, Queen Victoria, the
Prince Consort, and the young Princesses paid a short visit to
Ireland in order to see him in his new character of soldier.
On 26th August Her Majesty wrote in her diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>“At a little before 3 we went to Bertie’s hut, which is in
fact Sir George Brown’s. It is very comfortable&mdash;a nice little
bedroom, sitting-room, drawing-room, and good-sized dining-room,
where we lunched with our whole party. Colonel Percy
commands the Guards, and Bertie is placed specially under
him. I spoke to him, and thanked him for treating Bertie as
he did, just like any other officer, for I know that he keeps
him up to his work in a way, as General Bruce told me, that
no one else has done; and yet Bertie likes him very much.”</p>

<p>On the following day, which was a Sunday, the Prince Consort,
accompanied by the Prince of Wales and Prince Alfred,
went with Lord Carlisle to inspect the Dublin prisons.</p>

<p>Prince Albert spent his last birthday, 26th August 1861,
with his son in Ireland, and the Prince of Wales accompanied
his parents and sisters to Killarney, where they had a very
enthusiastic welcome. They travelled on the Prince Consort’s
birthday. On the 29th Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, with
their younger children, left Ireland, and writing to Baron
Stockmar on 6th September the Prince Consort said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> “The
Prince of Wales has acquitted himself extremely well in the
Camp, and looks forward with pleasure to his visit to the
manœuvres on the Rhine.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING’S VISIT TO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES</span></h2>

<p>During the Crimean war, Canada, stirred, as were all the
British colonies, by the direful stress of the mother country,
levied and equipped a regiment of infantry for service in the
field with the regular British troops&mdash;an interesting precedent
for what was to happen in the Boer war nearly half a century
later. In return for their demonstration of loyalty, the
Canadians dispatched a cordial invitation to Queen Victoria
to visit her American possessions; but it was considered undesirable
that Her Majesty should be exposed to the fatigues
and the risks of so long a journey.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria was then asked to appoint one of her sons
Governor-General of the Dominion, but the extreme youth of
all the Princes made that quite out of the question. Her
Majesty, nevertheless, formally promised that when the Prince
of Wales was old enough he should visit Canada in her stead.
When the Prince was well on in his eighteenth year his parents
decided that it was time for this promise to be fulfilled, the
more so that it would enable the great railway bridge across
the St. Lawrence at Montreal to be opened, and the foundation-stone
of the Parliament buildings at Ottawa to be laid, by a
Prince of the Blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fifth Duke of Newcastle, K.G.</span></p>

</div>

<p>The Prince Consort, with the care and forethought which
always distinguished him in such matters, made a most careful
choice of those who were to accompany his young son. Both
Queen Victoria and he felt the greatest confidence in the Duke
of Newcastle, the grandfather of the present peer, and with him
Prince Albert arranged all the details of the Prince’s Canadian
visit. The careful and kindly father forgot nothing that might
be needed. Not only did he take special pains to secure that
the young Prince should learn something of the history,
customs, and prejudices of the Canadian people, but he supplied
the Duke with memoranda which might be found useful in
drawing up the answers to be made to the addresses which
were certain to be presented to the Prince of Wales during his
progress through the Dominion. The best proof of the Prince
Consort’s wisdom is to be found in the fact that every one of
these notes afterwards turned out to be simply invaluable,
owing to the peculiar aptness with which they had been framed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to suit the circumstances of each locality where an address was
likely to be received.</p>

<p>When it became known on the American Continent that
the Prince of Wales was really coming to Canada, the President
of the United States, Mr. Buchanan, wrote to Queen Victoria
explaining how cordial a welcome the Prince of Wales would
receive at Washington should he extend his visit to the United
States.</p>

<p>Her Majesty returned a cordial answer, informing Mr.
Buchanan, and through him the American people, that the
Prince would return home through America, and that it would
give him great pleasure to have an opportunity of testifying to
the President in person the kindly feelings which animated the
British nation towards America. At the same time the
American people were told that the future British Sovereign
would, from the moment of his leaving British soil, drop all
Royal state, and that he would simply travel as “Lord Renfrew.”
In this again Her Majesty showed her great wisdom,
for it would have been extremely awkward for the Prince of
Wales, the descendant of King George III., to have visited
the American Republic in his quality as Heir-Apparent to the
British Throne.</p>

<p>After a pleasant but uneventful voyage on board the
frigate <i>Hero</i>, escorted by H.M.S. <i>Ariadne</i>, the Prince of
Wales first stepped on Transatlantic soil at St. John’s, the
capital of Newfoundland, the oldest British colony, on 24th
July 1860. The morning was rainy, but the moment His
Royal Highness landed the sun shone out, bursting through
the clouds, and this was considered by those present to be a
very happy omen.</p>

<p>On that day the Prince may be said to have really had his
first glimpse of that round of official duties to which he seemed
to take naturally, and in which he was destined to become so
expert.</p>

<p>After the Governor of Newfoundland had been formally
presented to the Prince, the Royal party, which comprised, in
addition to His Royal Highness, the Duke of Newcastle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
General Bruce, and Major Teesdale, went straight to Government
House, where the Prince held a reception, and listened to
a considerable number of addresses. The day did not end till
the next morning, for in the evening a grand ball was given by
Sir Alexander Bannerman, and King Edward won all hearts by
mixing freely with the company, and dancing, not only with the
ladies belonging to the Government and official circles, but
with the wives and daughters of the fishermen. It was noticed
that the Prince was quite remarkably like the portraits of his
Royal mother on the British coins, and he displayed, not only
in Newfoundland but also during the many fatiguing days
that followed, the extraordinary tact and admirable breeding
which have continually year after year increased the affection
with which he is regarded by the British people.</p>

by the King in Newfoundland:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His appearance is very much in his favour, and his
youth and royal dignified manners and bearing seem to have
touched all hearts, for there is scarcely a man or woman
who can speak of him without tears. The rough fishermen
and their wives are quite wild about him, and we hear
of nothing but their admiration. Their most frequent exclamation
is, ‘God bless his pretty face and send him a good wife.’”</p>

<p>At Halifax, the news that his sister, the Princess Frederick
of Prussia, had given birth to a little daughter met him, and
he hastened to write home his affectionate congratulations on
the event.</p>

<p>The Prince’s tour through Canada may be said to have
been one long triumphal procession. It was marred by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
unpleasant incident, in spite of the fact that at Kingston and
Toronto the Orangemen tried to induce the Prince to pass
under arches decorated with their party symbols and mottoes.
Thanks, however, to the Duke of Newcastle’s tact and firmness,
the attempt failed, and the incident merely served to illustrate
the young Prince’s freedom from party bias. Everywhere the
Royal visitor produced the happiest impressions, and, thanks
to his youth, he was able to endure considerable fatigue without
apparently being any the worse for it.</p>

<p>In America “Lord Renfrew’s” arrival was awaited with
the utmost impatience, and while travelling over the Dominion
His Royal Highness was surrounded by American reporters.
Indeed, it is said that the Prince of Wales’s visit to Canada
formed the first occasion on which press telegrams were used
to any lavish extent. One enterprising journalist used to
transmit to his paper long chapters from the Gospel according
to St. Matthew and from the Book of Revelation in order to
monopolise the wires while he was gathering material for his
daily report of the Royal journey. At a great ball given in
Quebec the Prince tripped and fell with his partner&mdash;the
article recording this event was headed <i>Honi soit qui mal y
pense</i>.</p>

<p>The Royal visit to Montreal is still remembered in Canada.
The Prince and his suite arrived there on 25th August, and the
Prince, after opening a local exhibition, inaugurating a bridge,
holding a review, and attending some native games, danced all
night with the greatest spirit, even singing with the band when
it struck up his favourite air.</p>

<p>Many little stories were told of the King’s good-nature and
affability. Hearing by accident that an old sailor who had
served with Nelson on board the <i>Trafalgar</i> had been court-martialled,
the Prince begged him off, and asked that he might
be restored to his rank in the service.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government provided a number of riding-horses
in order that the King might see Niagara Falls from
several points of view, and he has since often declared that
this was one of the finest sights he ever saw in his life. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
day, in the presence of the Royal party and of thousands of
spectators, Canadian and American, the famous rope-walker,
Blondin, crossed Niagara river upon a rope, walking upon
stilts, and carrying a man on his back. After the ordeal was
over, Blondin had the honour of being presented to the Prince.
The latter, with much emotion, exclaimed, “Thank God, it is
all over!” and begged him earnestly not to attempt the feat
again, but the famous rope-walker assured His Royal Highness
that there was no danger whatever, and offered to carry him
across on his back if he would go, but the Prince briefly
declined! The Prince seems to have been quite fascinated by
the marvellous Falls. On 17th September he insisted on riding
over on American ground for a farewell view of Niagara.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales formally crossed from Canadian
territory to the States on the night of 20th September, making
his appearance on Republican soil, as had been arranged, as
Lord Renfrew. At Hamilton, the last place in Canada where
he halted, the Prince made a speech, in the course of which
he observed:</p>

<p>“My duties as Representative of the Queen cease this day,
but in a private capacity I am about to visit before I return
home that remarkable land which claims with us a common
ancestry, and in whose extraordinary progress every Englishman
feels a common interest.”</p>

<p>Great as had been the enthusiasm in Canada, it may be
said to have been nothing to the <i>furore</i> of excitement produced
in America by the Prince of Wales’s visit. At Detroit the
crowds were so dense that the Royal party could not get to
their hotel through the main streets, and had to be smuggled
in at a side entrance. The whole city was illuminated; every
craft on the river had hung out lamps; and, as one individual
aptly put it, “there could not have been greater curiosity
to see him if the distinguished visitor had been George
Washington come to life again.”</p>

<p>Over 50,000 people came out to meet His Royal Highness
at Chicago, then a village of unfinished streets, but there, for
the first time, the Prince broke down from sheer fatigue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the Duke of Newcastle decided that it would be better to
break the trip from Chicago to St. Louis by stopping at a
quiet village, famed even then for the good sport to be
obtained in its neighbourhood. It was therefore arranged
that His Royal Highness should have a day’s shooting at
Dwight’s Station, and fourteen brace of quails and four rabbits
fell to the Prince’s gun.</p>

<p>A rather absurd incident marred the complete pleasure of
the day. As the Royal party approached a farm-house an
unmistakably British settler appeared at the door and invited
every one <i>excepting the Duke of Newcastle</i> to enter. “Not
you, Newcastle,” he shouted; “I have been a tenant of yours,
and have sworn that you shall never set a foot on my land.”
Accordingly the party passed on, and the farmer, though
revenged on his old landlord, had to forego the honour of
entertaining Royalty under his roof.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this awkward incident, the King
seems to have thoroughly enjoyed his little respite from
official functions. At one moment, when he was out on the
prairie, he and his companions desired to smoke, but nobody
had a light. At last a single match was found, but no one
volunteered to strike it. Lots were drawn with blades of
the prairie grass, and the King drew the shortest blade.
The others held their coats and hats round him whilst he
lighted the match, and he once said that he never felt so
nervous before or since.</p>

<p>On 30th October “Lord Renfrew” reached Washington,
and Lord Lyons, the British Minister, introduced him to President
James Buchanan, and Miss Harriet Lane, the latter’s
niece and housekeeper. The Prince stayed at the White
House, and President Buchanan, though he could not spare
his Royal guest a certain number of <i>levées</i> and receptions, did
his best to make his visit to the official centre of the American
Republic pleasant. During these five days there occurred a
most interesting event&mdash;the visit of His Royal Highness to
Mount Vernon and the tomb of Washington. A representative
of the <i>Times</i> gave the following eloquent account of the scene:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Before this humble tomb the Prince, the President, and
all the party stood uncovered. It is easy moralising on this
visit, for there is something grandly suggestive of historical
retribution in the reverential awe of the Prince of Wales, the
great-grandson of George III., standing bareheaded at the foot
of the coffin of Washington. For a few moments the party
stood mute and motionless, and the Prince then proceeded to
plant a chestnut by the side of the tomb. It seemed, when the
Royal youth closed in the earth around the little germ, that
he was burying the last faint trace of discord between us and
our great brethren in the West.”</p>

<p>Doubtless the Prince enjoyed these new experiences a good
deal more than did his guides, philosophers, and friends. Political
feeling ran high, and the pro-slavery leaders were very
anxious to influence public sentiment in Great Britain. They
formed the project of taking the Prince of Wales through the
South to see slavery under its pleasantest aspect as a paternal
institution. After a good deal of discussion between the Duke
of Newcastle and Lord Lyons, it was felt better to accept the
invitation of some representative Southerners, and accordingly
the Prince went a short tour to Richmond; but it may be
added that a great slave sale which had been widely advertised
was postponed so as not to offend British susceptibilities. The
Prince does not seem to have been at all impressed by the
slave cities, and he flatly refused to leave his carriage to visit
the negro quarters at Haxhall’s plantation, and so he returned
to Washington, having shown a good deal more common sense
than had those about him.</p>

<p>The day that the Prince left Washington for Richmond,
President Buchanan wrote a charming letter to the Queen, in
which he said, speaking of his guest: “In our domestic circle
he has won all hearts. His free and ingenuous intercourse
with myself evinced both a kind heart and a good understanding.”</p>

<p>From Washington the Prince proceeded to Philadelphia,
and there, for the first time, His Royal Highness heard Adelina
Patti. He was so greatly charmed with her marvellous voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and winning personality, that he begged that she might be
presented to him.</p>

<p>The Prince’s feelings must have been strangely mixed when
he stood in Independence Hall, but he does not appear to have
revealed them by making any remark, and after staying a
few days in Philadelphia he started for New York, where
he received a splendid welcome from Father Knickerbocker,
being met at the station by the Mayor, and driven through
Broadway to the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Half a million spectators
saw him arrive, and so great was the anxiety to see
Queen Victoria’s eldest son at close quarters, that there was
no structure in New York large enough to contain those who
thought that they had&mdash;and who no doubt had&mdash;a right to meet
the Prince of Wales at a social function.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grand Ball given at the Academy of Music, New York</span></p>

<p><i>From the “Illustrated London News”</i></p>

</div>

<p>At last a building was found capable of containing 6000
people; but, looking to the question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> “crinolines and comfort,”
it was reluctantly decided that not more than 3000 cards of
invitation, admitting to the ball and to the supper to follow,
should be sent out. Fortunately most of the 3000 guests
were important people, and therefore too old to dance. They
represented, in both senses of the word, the solid element in
New York society, for, as they crowded round the Prince, the
floor gave way, and it is a wonder that no serious accident took
place. This splendid entertainment, which took place in the
old Academy of Music, is still remembered by many elderly
Americans. The Prince showed his tact and good taste by
frequently changing his partner. For the supper, a special
service of china and glass had been manufactured, the Prince’s
motto, <i>Ich Dien</i>, being emblazoned on every piece.</p>

<p>During the five days that the Prince remained in New
York, he was the guest of the Mayor and of the Corporation.
He seems to have most enjoyed a parade of the Volunteer
Fire Department in his honour. There were 6000 firemen in
uniform, and all, save those in charge of the ropes and tillers,
bore torches. It was a magnificent spectacle, and the Prince,
as he looked at the brilliant display in Madison Square, cried
repeatedly, “This is for me, this is all for me!” with unaffected
glee.</p>

<p>From New York the Prince went on to Albany and Boston,
and at the latter place Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Emerson, and a number of other notable Americans were
presented to him. He visited Harvard College, spent an
hour at Mount Auburn, where he planted two trees, and drove
out to Bunker’s Hill.</p>

<p>Portland was the last place visited by the Prince in the
United States, and on 20th October the Royal party set sail
for home on board the <i>Hero</i>, which was escorted by the
<i>Ariadne</i>, the <i>Nile</i>, and the <i>Styx</i>. The voyage home was not
as uneventful as had been the voyage out. So anxious were
they at Court about the fate of the <i>Hero</i>, that two ships of
war were sent in search of the frigate and her escort. At
last, to every one’s great relief, the <i>Hero</i> was sighted, and it
was ascertained that a sudden storm had driven the boat back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from the British coast, and the Royal party had been reduced
to salt fare, with only a week’s provisions in store.</p>

<p>On 9th November the Prince Consort put in his diary:
“Bertie’s birthday. Unfortunately he is still absent, neither
do we hear anything from him.” Great, therefore, was the
joy of the Queen and Prince Albert when, on 15th November,
they received a telegram from Plymouth announcing the safe
arrival of their son. That same evening the Prince of Wales
arrived at Windsor Castle, being greeted with the warmest
affection by his family and friends.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria showed the most vivid interest in all her
eldest son’s many and varied adventures. Both Her Majesty
and the Prince Consort were very much gratified by the way
in which the Duke of Newcastle had performed his arduous
and delicate task, and, after some consultation, it was decided
that the Queen should publicly mark her satisfaction by conferring
upon the Duke the Order of the Garter.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">DEATH OF THE PRINCE CONSORT&mdash;TOUR IN THE EAST</span></h2>

<p>King Edward’s visit to Germany in the autumn of 1861 is
explained by Sir Theodore Martin, in his <i>Life of the Prince
Consort</i>, to have been made with another object in view besides
that of seeing the military manœuvres in the Rhenish Provinces.
It had been arranged that he was to make the acquaintance of
the Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who was then on a visit
to Germany, with a view to a marriage, should the meeting
result in a mutual attachment.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of every precaution to ensure secrecy,
until at least the inclinations of the principal parties should
have been ascertained, the project leaked out, and even before
they met, it was actually canvassed, much to the Prince
Consort’s annoyance, in the Continental papers. From these
it soon found its way into the English journals, where it met
with general approval; but as the meeting, which took place
at Speier and Heidelberg on the 24th and 25th of September,
ended with the happiest results, no harm was done, though in
other circumstances it might have been extremely painful.</p>

<p>“We hear nothing but excellent accounts of the Princess
Alexandra,” Prince Albert notes in his diary on the 30th of
September, and he adds, with evident satisfaction, that “the
young people seem to have taken a warm liking for each
other.” On 6th October the Prince Consort, writing to the
King of Prussia, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> “Bertie has come back in raptures
with his excursion to the manœuvres, and cannot speak sufficiently
highly of your kindness to himself, and to all the
English officers.” About a week later the Prince Consort was
able to write to Baron Stockmar: “The Prince of Wales leaves
to-morrow for Cambridge. He came back greatly pleased with
his interview with the Princess of Holstein at Speier.… His
present wish, after his time at the University is up, which it
will be at Christmas, is to travel; and we have gladly assented
to his proposal to visit the Holy Land. This, under existing
circumstances, is the most useful tour he can make, and will
occupy him till early in June.”</p>

<p>The Prince Consort that same autumn went specially to
London in order to inspect the alterations that were being
made at Marlborough House, which was then being actively
prepared as a residence for the Prince of Wales; and on the
9th Queen Victoria wrote in her diary: “This is our dear
Bertie’s twentieth birthday. I pray God to assist our efforts
to make him turn out well.… All our people in and out of
the house came in to dinner. Bertie led me in by Albert’s
wish, and I sat between him and Albert.”</p>

<p>Prince Albert paid a hurried visit on 28th November to
Cambridge in order to visit the Prince of Wales. The
weather was cold and stormy, and he returned to Windsor
with a heavy cold.</p>

<p>The next few days were spent by both the Prince Consort
and Queen Victoria in considerable anxiety. The seizure of
the <i>Trent</i> aroused a great deal of bitter public feeling, and the
fact that America was convulsed by civil war did not make the
position of Great Britain more easy. The Government adopted
a very resolute attitude, and the Prince Consort, instead of
allowing himself to be nursed through his feverish attack, spent
some hours in composing and writing a draft, on the burning
question of the day, to Lord Russell.</p>

<p>The story of those sad days is well known. As time went
on, Prince Albert grew slightly worse rather than better, but
no real danger was apprehended by those nearest and dearest
to him, and Queen Victoria would not hear of having the
Prince of Wales summoned, until at last Princess Alice, who
behaved with extraordinary fortitude and marvellous self-possession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
felt that she must send for her eldest brother on
her own responsibility. She accordingly did so, and King
Edward was always, up to the day of her death, very grateful
to her for her prompt action, because it enabled him to arrive
in time to be present at his much-loved father’s death-bed.
Although she was herself overwhelmed with bitter grief, it was
to the Princess Alice that all turned, for Queen Victoria was
so completely overcome that nothing could be referred to her,
and it was finally arranged that the Prince of Wales and the
Princesses Alice and Helena should accompany their mother to
Osborne, where she had consented very reluctantly to go.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales returned immediately, in order to
complete the arrangements for the funeral, and to receive his
uncle the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, his brother-in-law
the Crown Prince of Prussia (afterwards the Emperor Frederick),
and the other foreign mourners who were to take part in the
last sad ceremony.</p>

<p>The funeral took place on 23rd December, the service being
held in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor. The chief mourner
was, of course, the Prince of Wales, who was supported, in the
absence of Prince Alfred (Duke of Edinburgh), by Prince
Arthur. All those present were deeply moved by the grief
of the two young princes. They both hid their faces, and after
the coffin had been lowered into the vault the Prince of Wales
advanced to take a last look and stood for one moment looking
down; then, his fortitude deserting him, he burst into a flood
of tears, and was led away by the Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Sad indeed were the days that followed. The effect of the
Prince Consort’s death on King Edward’s affectionate and
sensitive nature was terrible, and those about the Court felt
that something must be done to rouse him from his grief.</p>

</div>

<p>As we have already seen, the Prince Consort, not long
before his death, had assented to his eldest son’s proposal of
making a tour in the Holy Land, and it had also been his
earnest wish that His Royal Highness should on that occasion
be accompanied by the Rev. Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, who had
himself already taken a journey to Jerusalem. And so, when
the tour was decided upon as a means of rousing the Prince of
Wales from his stupor of grief, Queen Victoria made up her
mind that she would be guided by her late Consort’s wishes,
and General Bruce was commanded to write to Dr. Stanley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but not till he reached Osborne was he actually asked whether
he would consent to undertake the responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King’s Reception by Said Pacha, Viceroy of Egypt, at Cairo</span></p>

<p><i>From the “Illustrated London News”</i></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Stanley, though he regarded the proposal with reluctance
and misgiving, for he could not bear to leave his aged mother,
to whom he was most tenderly devoted, consented to do as Her
Majesty wished. It was ultimately arranged that he should
meet the Prince at Alexandria, ascend the Nile with him, and
accompany him, not only through the Holy Land, but on the
Egyptian portion of the expedition.</p>

<p>On 28th February King Edward, accompanied by General
Bruce, Major Teesdale, Captain Keppel, and a small suite, was
joined by Dr. Stanley, the party at once proceeding to Cairo.
“The Prince,” wrote General Bruce to his sister, “takes great
delight in the new world on which he has entered, and Dr.
Stanley is a great acquisition.” They visited the Pyramids
together, and then resumed their voyage, the Prince characteristically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
persuading Dr. Stanley to read <i>East Lynne</i>, a book
which had greatly struck his imagination. When recording the
circumstance, Dr. Stanley adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is impossible not to like him, and to be constantly with
him brings out his astonishing memory of names and persons.…
I am more and more struck by the amiable and endearing
qualities of the Prince.… His Royal Highness had himself
laid down a rule that there was to be no shooting to-day
(Sunday), and though he was sorely tempted, as we passed
flocks of cranes and geese seated on the bank in the most
inviting crowds, he rigidly conformed to it; a crocodile was
allowed to be a legitimate exception, but none appeared. He
sat alone on the deck with me, talking in the frankest manner,
for an hour in the afternoon, and made the most reasonable and
proper remarks on the due observance of Sunday in England.”</p>

<p>A sad event which occurred in March was destined to draw
closer together the ties which were now binding His Royal
Highness and his chaplain, for on 23rd March the news was
broken to Dr. Stanley that his mother was dead. The Prince
of Wales showed the kindest and most tender consideration for
his bereaved travelling companion, and was much gratified that
Dr. Stanley very wisely made up his mind to continue the
journey instead of hurrying home at once.</p>

<p>A few days later the Royal party reached Palestine, and it
is interesting to note that this was the first time that the heir
to the English throne, since the days of Edward I. and Eleanor,
had visited the Holy City. King Edward landed at Jaffa on
31st March, and both on his entrance into the Holy Land and
during his approach to Jerusalem he followed in the footsteps
of Richard Cœur de Lion and Edward I. The cavalcade,
escorted by a troop of Turkish cavalry, climbed the Pass of
Bethhoron, catching their first glimpse of Jerusalem from the spot
where Richard is recorded to have hidden his face in his shield,
with the words, “Ah, Lord God, if I am not thought worthy
to win back the Holy Sepulchre, I am not worthy to see it!”</p>

<p>The King, accompanied by Dr. Stanley, carefully explored
Jerusalem and its neighbourhood, riding over the hills of Judæa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to Bethlehem, walking through the famous groves of Jericho,
and staying some time at Bethany.</p>

<p>“Late in the afternoon,” writes Dr. Stanley, “we reached
Bethany. I then took my place close beside the Prince. Every
one else fell back by design or accident, and at the head of the
cavalcade we moved on towards the famous view. This was
the one half-hour which, throughout the journey, I had determined
to have alone with the Prince, and I succeeded.”</p>

<p>During Dr. Stanley’s previous journey to the Holy Land
he had not been permitted to visit the closely-guarded cave of
Machpelah, but on this occasion, thanks to the diplomacy of
General Bruce, not only the King, but also his chaplain, were
allowed to set foot within the sacred precincts. Even to Royal
personages the Mosque of Hebron had remained absolutely
barred for nearly seven hundred years, and on the present
occasion the Turkish official in charge declared that “for no
one but for the eldest son of the Queen of England would he
have allowed the gate to be opened; indeed, the Princes of any
other nation should have passed over his body before doing so.”</p>

<p>King Edward, with his usual thoughtfulness, had made Dr.
Stanley’s entrance with himself a condition of his going in at
all, and when the latter went up to the King to thank him and
to say that but for him he would never have had this great
opportunity, the young man answered with touching and
almost reproachful simplicity, “High station, you see, sir, has,
after all, some merits, some advantages.” “Yes, sir,” replied
Dr. Stanley, “and I hope that you will always make as good

<p>On the party’s return to Jerusalem, they witnessed the
Samaritan Passover, and Easter Sunday, 20th April, was
spent by the shores of Lake Tiberias.</p>

<p>During the journey from Tiberias to Damascus King
Edward and his escort lived in tents, an experience which
he seems to have thoroughly enjoyed. From Damascus the
party turned westward, reaching Beyrout on 6th May, and
after visiting Tyre and Sidon they proceeded to Tripoli. On
13th May the King left the shores of Syria, visiting on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>

<p>It was very characteristic of King Edward’s readiness to
take any trouble to please those dear to him that wherever he
went he collected a number of flowers or leaves from every
famous spot. These, after having been carefully dried by
him, were sent to his sister, the Princess Royal, afterwards the
Empress Frederick, who had a particular taste for such memorials.</p>

<p>It was very soon after his return from the East that the
King played for the first time an important part in a family
gathering&mdash;the wedding of his favourite sister, Princess Alice,
to Prince Louis of Hesse. The bride was given away by her
uncle, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but the young
Prince of Wales acted as master of the house during the quiet
week which preceded the ceremony.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WEDDING OF KING EDWARD AND QUEEN ALEXANDRA</span></h2>

<p>As is very generally known, the marriage of King Edward to
Princess Alexandra of Denmark was brought about in quite a
romantic fashion. It is said that long before His Majesty saw
his future wife he was very much attracted by a glimpse of her
photograph, shown him by one of his friends.</p>

<p>A more authoritative story of a photograph is told in the
memoir of the late Duchess of Teck. The meeting at Heidelberg
in September 1861, already referred to, took place when
the Danish Princess and her father were on their way to join
one of those famous family gatherings at Rumpenheim, and the
Duchess of Teck’s biographer writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As soon as the Princess arrived at the Hessian Palace,
her cousins were most anxious to hear all about the meeting,
and much excitement followed when Princess Alexandra, producing
a photograph from her pocket, laughingly exclaimed, ‘I
have got him here!’”</p>

<p>It is certain that though many Princesses had been spoken
of in connection with the Prince, and at one time negotiations
were actually impending with a view to his engagement to the
daughter of a German Royal House, all such schemes were
instantly abandoned after he had seen the beautiful Danish
Princess.</p>

<p>Another meeting is said to have taken place in the
Cathedral of Worms during this eventful tour in 1861. The
Prince, accompanied by his tutor and equerry, had gone to
examine the frescoes, and when wandering through the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
old Cathedral they met Prince Christian of Denmark and his
daughter intent on the same object.</p>

<p>Later, after the Prince Consort’s death, during a short visit
which he paid to his cousin, the King of the Belgians, the Heir-Apparent
again met Princess Alexandra, and it is said that King
Leopold had a considerable share in arranging the preliminaries
of the marriage, for it was while the Prince and Princess were
both staying at Laeken that Queen Victoria’s formal consent
to her son’s making a Danish alliance was granted.</p>

<p>The formal betrothal took place on 9th September 1862,
but even then what had occurred was only known to a comparatively
small circle of friends and relations, for it was not till
the eve of His Royal Highness’s coming of age that his engagement
was formally announced in the <i>London Gazette</i>, and so
made known to the whole British Empire.</p>

<p>The announcement roused the greatest enthusiasm, for deep
as had been the public sympathy with Her Majesty, a widowed
Court could not but cast a very real gloom, not only over
society, but over all those directly and indirectly interested in
the sumptuary trades and the wide distribution of wealth. It
was universally felt that the marriage of the Heir-Apparent
would inaugurate a new era of prosperity, and scarce a dissenting
voice was raised to oppose the Grant voted by the House
of Commons for the Royal couple.</p>

<p>On the proposal of Lord Palmerston, it was decided that
the Prince of Wales should receive from the country an income
of £40,000 a year, with an added £10,000 a year to be specially
set apart for the Princess. And so it came to pass that the
Heir-Apparent and his bride began housekeeping with an
income of somewhat over £100,000 a year, for, owing to the
Prince Consort’s foresight and good sense, out of the savings
made during his son’s long minority, Sandringham, of which
the initial cost was £220,000, had been purchased.</p>

<p>Unlike most Royal engagements, that of the Prince and
Princess of Wales lasted nearly six months, but active preparations
for the wedding did not begin till the official announcement
had been made.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph in the possession of the King of Denmark, taken on 1st December 1862</i></p>

</div>

<p>Although Princess Alexandra had visited England as a
child in order to make the acquaintance of her great-aunt, the
Duchess of Cambridge, it was at Laeken that she was presented
to her future mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, who was then
paying a visit <i>incognito</i> to King Leopold. Later on, the young
Princess, accompanied by her father, paid Queen Victoria an
informal visit at Osborne. She did not on this occasion come to
London or take part in any public function, but rumours of her
beauty and of her charm of manner had become rife, and as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
wedding day, which had been fixed for 10th March, approached,
the public interest and excitement were strung to the highest
pitch. It was felt that Denmark’s loss was Britain’s gain, and
Alfred Tennyson, the Poet Laureate, voiced most happily the
universal feeling in his fine lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent2">And welcome her, welcome the land’s desire,</div>
<div class="verse right">Alexandra.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With what feelings the event was regarded among King
Edward’s near relatives may be estimated from the following
characteristically warm-hearted references in the diary of the
late Duchess of Teck, whose mother, the Duchess of Cambridge,
was the bride’s great-aunt:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Brighton, November 9.</i>&mdash;The Prince of Wales&mdash;God bless
him!&mdash;attains his majority (21) to-day. After luncheon we
watched anxiously for the expected and longed-for arrival of
dear Christian, who was on his way back to Copenhagen, having
established Alix at Osborne. At half-past three we had the
happiness of welcoming him, and for upwards of three hours
sat talking over the <i>Verlobung</i> [betrothal] of Alix and Bertie.
We had much to hear and discuss, and while fully sharing his
happiness at the marriage we could enter into his feelings at
leaving Alix thus for the first time. We dined at eight o’clock,
a party of five, and toasted our dear Prince in champagne.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>“<i>Cambridge Cottage, November 21.</i>&mdash;… We reached Windsor
Castle about twelve, and were shown into our old Lancaster
Tower rooms, where we were presently joined by darling Alix,&mdash;too
overjoyed at the meeting to speak!&mdash;dear Alice and
Louis; after a while Alix took me to her room.… I then
returned to the others, and we went with Alice to see her
rooms in the Devil’s Tower, where Louis was being <i>sketched</i>;
here the poor dear Queen joined us and remained with us for
some time. We lunched without Her Majesty, and Beatrice
came in afterwards.… Went into Alix’s room again and
played to her <i>en souvenir de Rumpenheim</i>, afterwards accompanying
her into all the state-rooms, Mama, Alice, Louis, and
Helena being also of the party. On our return Mama and I
were summoned to the Queen’s Closet, and had a nice little
talk with her, ending with tea. We were hurried off shortly
before five, Alix, Alice, and the others rushing after us to bid
us good-bye.”</p>

<p>Even the humblest of His Majesty’s subjects usually finds
a good deal to do in the weeks that precede his marriage, and
it will be easily understood that the high station of the future
King rather augmented than diminished these engrossing
occupations. He had to receive and suitably acknowledge
countless addresses of congratulation from individuals, corporations,
and other public bodies; he had to superintend the
extensive alterations which were still being carried out at
Marlborough House; he had to pass in review the innumerable
details of the various elaborate functions which were to mark
the occasion of his marriage; and last but not least it was
considered desirable that he should now go through the somewhat
trying ceremony of taking his seat in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Nearly three-quarters of a century had elapsed since the
Heir-Apparent to the British Crown had taken the oath and
his seat as a Peer of the Realm. It was on 5th February 1863,
within a few weeks of his marriage, that King Edward went
through this historic ceremony, and it is a curious fact that the
business before the House of Lords on that occasion was an
Address from the Crown to the British Parliament announcing
the Prince’s approaching marriage. It is also noteworthy that
soon after the ceremony the two chief dignitaries of the English
Church, the new Archbishops of Canterbury and York, also
took the oaths and their seats upon the Episcopal benches of
the House.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Mary and a
brilliant array of Peeresses and ladies from the various foreign
Embassies and Legations were present at the ceremony, which
was invested with a great deal of pomp and solemnity. After
prayers had been read by the Bishop of Worcester, a procession
emerged from the Prince’s Chamber, and advanced slowly up
the floor of the House. First came the Usher of the Black
Rod, followed immediately by the Garter King of Arms, attired
in his robes. Then came the Prince of Wales, preceded by
an equerry, bearing his coronet on an embroidered crimson
cushion. His Royal Highness was also accompanied by
the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of Argyll, the Hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Lord Great Chamberlain, and Lord Edward Howard, who represented
the infant Duke of Norfolk, Hereditary Earl Marshal.</p>

<p><i>From the Painting by Madame Jerichau, published by Henry Graves and Co.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The Prince wore the scarlet and ermine robes of a Duke
over the uniform of a General. He also wore the Order of
the Garter, the Order of the Golden Fleece, and the Order
of the Star of India. As he entered the House, the Peers
rose in a body, the Lord Chancellor alone remaining seated
and covered with his official hat. His Royal Highness then
advanced to the Woolsack, and placed his patent of peerage
and writ of summons in the hands of the Chancellor. The
oaths were administered to him at the table by the Clerk of
Parliament, the titles under which the Prince was sworn being
those of Duke of Cornwall, Earl of Chester, Earl of Carrick,
Duke of Rothesay, and Lord of the Isles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>After the roll had been signed the procession moved on,
and His Royal Highness, on reaching the right-hand side of
the Throne, took his seat upon the Chair of State specially
appropriated on State occasions to the Prince of Wales. While
thus seated he placed on his head the cocked hat worn by
general officers in full dress. The Prince and the other Peers
finally left the House, retiring by the entrance at the right
of the Throne in the same order as they had entered.</p>

<p>About an hour later His Royal Highness re-entered the
House dressed in ordinary afternoon costume, and took his
seat on one of the cross-benches, thereby formally dissociating
himself from either political party. The Prince remained
almost throughout the entire debate. When leaving he
shook hands with the Earl of Derby and a number of other
Peers whom he recognised.</p>

<p>As is well known, the only votes which King Edward has
ever given in the House of Lords have been in favour of the
Bill for legalising marriage with a deceased wife’s sister, but
he is a constant visitor at the Houses of Parliament when
anything of special interest is going on, and there is no doubt
that he takes the keenest interest in the political questions of
the day.</p>

<p>As regards the Deceased Wife’s Sister Bill, it is well
known that the King and the Bench of Bishops hold opposite
opinions, and there is a curious allusion to this in the <i>Life</i> of
the late Archbishop Benson. The Archbishop went to a great
garden party given by Queen Victoria in July 1896, and thus
describes it in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Queen’s Garden Party at Buckingham Palace was of
4000 persons.… The Prince, after glancing my way several
times, came up, holding out his hand <i>as if</i> diffidently, and
saying, ‘Will you shake hands with me?’ I said, ‘Vicisti,
sir.’ He said, ‘What?’ But on my saying again, ‘Vicisti,’
he laughed very heartily in his own way.” It should be
explained that the Prince and the Duke of York had just
voted in the House of Lords in favour of the Deceased Wife’s
Sister Bill, the third reading of which was passed.</p>

<p>The Danish people were extremely pleased at the marriage
their Princess was making, and so determined were they that
she should not go dowerless, that 100,000 kroner, known as
“the People’s Dowry,” were presented to her, and countless
presents, many of them of the humblest description, poured
in upon her from all over the sea-girt kingdom. By the
Princess’s own wish, 3000 thalers were distributed among
six Danish brides belonging to the poorer classes during
the year of Her Royal Highness’s marriage. The fact
became known, and naturally greatly added to Her Royal
Highness’s popularity, and from the day she left Copenhagen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to that on which she landed on British soil, the journey of
Prince Christian and his family, for Princess Alexandra was
accompanied by her father and mother, and brothers and
sisters, was nothing short of a triumphal progress.</p>

<p>The Royal <i>cortège</i> left Denmark on 26th February, reaching
Cologne on 2nd March. There the Prince of Wales’s <i>fiancée</i>
received the first greetings of her future husband’s people, the
British residents. The whole party were also royally entertained
at Brussels by the Count of Flanders; and at Flushing they
found a squadron of British men-of-war to escort the Royal
yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>.</p>

<p>On the morning of 7th March the Danish Royal Family
first saw the white cliffs of Old England, and at twenty minutes
past eleven, the Royal yacht, which had steamed slowly up
the river amid craft splendidly decorated with flags and flowers,
anchored opposite the pier at Gravesend. A moment later
the Prince of Wales, accompanied by a numerous suite, and
attired in a blue frock-coat and gray trousers, stepped on board.
As His Royal Highness reached the deck Princess Alexandra
advanced to the door of the State cabin to meet him, and, to
the great delight of the assembled crowds ashore and afloat,
the Prince, walking quickly towards his bride, took her by the
hand and kissed her most affectionately.</p>

<p>Then followed the procession through London; every street,
from the humblest portions of the East End to the great West
End thoroughfares, was lavishly decorated, and the Prince and
Princess accepted addresses presented by the Corporation and
many other London public bodies.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales gave some special sittings for a
medal which was struck to commemorate her public entry into
the City of London, and it remains one of the finest examples of
Wyon’s art. The reverse represents the Princess Alexandra,
led by the Prince of Wales, and attended by Hymen, being
welcomed by the City of London, who is accompanied by
Peace and Plenty, the latter carrying the diamond necklace
and earrings which the City offered to the Princess as a
wedding present. In the background is the triumphal arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
erected by the Corporation at London Bridge, where Her
Royal Highness first entered the City precincts. The medals
were struck only in bronze, and were presented to Queen
Victoria, King Edward, and Queen Alexandra, all the members
of the Royal family, the Royal and distinguished guests who
were asked to the wedding, and the members of the Corporation
of the City of London.</p>

<p>The poor young Princess must have been glad when that
long day came to an end, for the Royal train from Paddington
to Windsor did not start till a quarter past five, and thus from
early morning till late in the afternoon the future Queen had
been compelled to remain the cynosure of all eyes. It is an
interesting fact that the engine which took the Princess to
Windsor was driven by the Earl of Caithness, then the best
known amateur locomotive engineer of the day.</p>

<p>As may easily be imagined, the Royal borough was determined
not to be outdone by London in the matter of a bridal
welcome. The Eton boys presented an address signed by the
whole 800; and then came the arrival at the Castle, where
Queen Victoria, surrounded by all her children and a large
number of Royal visitors, received her future daughter-in-law.
Then followed two days of almost complete rest for the
Princess.</p>

<p>King Edward, in addition to the multifarious duties which
beset even humble individuals when they are about to enter
the holy estate, was also compelled to hold his first <i>levée</i> within
a few days of his wedding. Over a thousand gentlemen had
the honour of being presented to him, the presentations, by
Queen Victoria’s pleasure, being considered as equal to presentations
to Her Majesty. The <i>levée</i>, which was held in St.
James’s Palace, was also attended by about seventeen hundred
of the nobility and gentry, all anxious to do honour to the
Heir-Apparent, who was, it need hardly be added, attended by
a brilliant Court.</p>

<p>The Prince and the British Royal Family had not been idle
during the period of the engagement. His Royal Highness
himself ordered and examined the designs for all the gifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
about to be presented by him to his bride, and to her family
whom he specially wished to honour. His first present to
her, the engagement ring, has since served as keeper for the
Princess’s wedding ring. It is a very beautiful example of the
jeweller’s art, being set with six precious stones&mdash;a beryl, an
emerald, a ruby, a turquoise, a jacinth, and a second emerald,
the initials of the six gems spelling the Prince’s family name,
“Bertie.” His Royal Highness’s gifts also included a complete
set of diamonds and pearls, comprising diadem, necklace,
stomacher, and bracelet; also a very beautiful waist-clasp,
formed of two large turquoises inlaid with Arabic characters,
and mounted in gold.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria presented her daughter-in-law with a set of
opals and diamonds exactly similar in form to that designed for
Princess Alice by the Prince Consort. Her Majesty also gave
the Prince a centre-piece, which was presented to him in the
name of the Prince Consort and of herself. This fine piece of
work had been designed by the Prince Consort as a gift to his
son. It has a group at the base showing Edward I. presenting
his heir to the Welsh chieftains, and round the base are
portraits of six Princes of Wales. Queen Victoria, whose
thoughtful care was shown in this as in many other matters,
gave the Prince and his bride a great deal of valuable plate
as well.</p>

<p>The London jewellers had certainly cause for rejoicing over
the Royal marriage, for the Prince, not content with presenting
his bride-elect with a number of other very costly gifts, also
showered gems on all his own and her relations. Neither were
his friends forgotten. He ordered twenty breast-pins, heart-shaped,
encircled by brilliants, with the initials of himself and
the Princess traced in rubies, diamonds, and emeralds occupying
the centre of each heart. These were distributed to his
brothers and to a number of his intimates. To his future
mother-in-law, Princess Christian of Denmark, the Prince gave
a beautiful bracelet, containing a miniature of himself; also a
diamond, ruby, and emerald brooch, inscribed with the date
of the marriage, and containing miniature portraits of himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and the Princess. An exactly similar jewel was presented by
Princess Alexandra to the Queen.</p>

<p>In order efficiently to conduct the Royal wedding in St.
George’s Chapel at Windsor, it became necessary to build
proper apartments for the accommodation of the bride and
bridegroom on their arrival, and for the Lord Chamberlain to
marshal the processions without any danger of a hitch. With
this object the Board of Works built an immense Gothic hall,
opening out of the west door of the Chapel, and surrounded
by apartments appropriated to the use of the Royal Family.
Facing the Chapel, the two rooms upon the right were
assigned to the bridegroom, and those on the left to the bride.</p>

<p>The marriage of King Edward and Queen Alexandra was
the first Royal marriage which had been celebrated in St.
George’s Chapel since that of Henry I. in 1122. The day was
kept as a public holiday throughout the country, and the
attention of the whole kingdom was concentrated on Windsor.
The ceremony took place on 10th March 1863, at 12 o’clock.
The total number of persons admitted to the Chapel did not
exceed 900 ladies and gentlemen, exclusive of the Guards and
of the attendants on duty.</p>

<p>The scene will never be forgotten by those who had the
privilege of being present. It was an extraordinarily magnificent
pageant, heralds and trumpeters in coats of cloth of gold
adding greatly to the brilliancy and pomp.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria surveyed the scene from the Royal closet,
which, placed on the north side of the Communion Table, is
really a small room in the body of the Castle with a window
opening into the Chapel. Her Majesty was clad in deep black,
even to her gloves, and she wore a close-fitting widow’s cap,
but in deference to the occasion she had consented to put on
the broad blue riband of the Order of the Garter with the
glittering star, and this was specially noticed by the few
persons who, from the body of the Chapel, caught a glimpse of
their beloved Sovereign.</p>

<p>The bridegroom, as in duty bound, arrived some time
before the bride. He was supported by his uncle, the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and his brother-in-law, the Crown
Prince of Prussia, and wore the uniform of a British General,
the Collar of the Garter, the Order of the Star of India, and
the rich flowing purple velvet mantle of a Knight of the Garter.
His supporters also wore the robes of the Garter, and the three
were naturally the centre of interest till the arrival of the bride,
who came in upon the stroke of half-past twelve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Contemporary Design for the Royal Wedding</span></p>

</div>

<p>Princess Alexandra, who was given away by her father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wore, according to the notions of that day, a very beautiful and
splendid wedding dress. It consisted of a white satin skirt,
trimmed with garlands of orange blossom and puffings of tulle
and Honiton lace, the bodice being draped with the same lace,
while the train of silver moire antique was covered with nosegays
of orange blossom and puffings of tulle. In addition to
the necklace, earrings, and brooch presented to Her Royal
Highness by the bridegroom, she wore the <i>rivière</i> of diamonds
given by the Corporation of London, and three bracelets,
presented to her respectively by Queen Victoria, the ladies of
Leeds, and the ladies of Manchester. On her beautiful hair,
which was very simply dressed, lay a wreath of orange blossoms
covered by a veil of Honiton lace.</p>

<p>The bridal bouquet was composed of orange blossoms, white
rosebuds, orchids, and sprigs of myrtle, the latter being taken
from the same bush as that from which the myrtle used in the
Princess Royal’s bridal bouquet was cut.</p>

<p>As the Princess moved slowly up the Chapel her train was
carried by eight bridesmaids, Lady Victoria Scott, Lady Victoria
Howard, Lady Agneta Yorke, Lady Feodora Wellesley, Lady
Diana Beauclerk, Lady Georgina Hamilton, Lady Alma Bruce,
and Lady Helena Hare. They each wore dresses of white
tulle over white glacé silk, trimmed with blush roses, shamrocks,
and white heather, with wreaths to correspond, and each
also wore a locket presented to her by the Prince of Wales,
composed of coral and diamonds, signifying the red and white
which are the colours of Denmark, while in the centre of each
was a crystal cipher forming the letters “A. E. A.” twined
together in a monogram designed by Princess Alice.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that all these ladies are still living,
or were until quite lately, and many of them became Queen
Alexandra’s personal friends. Even now Her Majesty occasionally
wears the splendid diamond and enamelled bracelet,
made in eight compartments, each containing a miniature of
one of the Royal bridesmaids, which was their gift to her on
the occasion of the marriage.</p>

<p>The ceremony itself did not last very long. The Prince is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
recorded to have answered his “I will” right manfully, but the
Princess’s answers were almost inaudible. As soon as the
Prince of Wales and the Princess Alexandra were man and
wife, they turned to the congregation hand in hand, bowing low
to the Queen, who, in returning the salutation, made a gesture
of blessing rather than of ceremonious acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The late Bishop Wilberforce thus describes the scene in
the Chapel:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The wedding was certainly the most moving sight I ever
saw. The Queen, above all, looking down, added such a
wonderful chord of feeling to all the lighter notes of joyfulness
and show. Every one behaved quite at their best. The
Princess of Wales, calm, feeling, self-possessed; the Prince
with more depth of manner than ever before.”</p>

<p>Dr. Norman Macleod wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I returned home and went back to the marriage on the
10th of March.… I got behind Kingsley, Stanley, Birch, and
in a famous place, being in front of the Royal pair. We saw
better than any except the clergy. It was a gorgeous sight,
yet somehow did not excite me. I suppose I am past this.</p>

<p>“Two things struck me much. One was the whole of the
Royal Princesses weeping, though concealing their tears with
their bouquets, as they saw their brother, who was to them
but their ‘Bertie,’ and their dead father’s son, standing alone
waiting for his bride. The other was the Queen’s expression
as she raised her eyes to Heaven, while her husband’s Chorale
was sung. She seemed to be with him alone before the throne
of God.”</p>

<p>Mr. W. P. Frith, who had been commissioned to execute
a painting of the Royal marriage for Queen Victoria, was
accommodated with a special corner for himself and his sketch-book,
and later, all those who had taken part in the historic
pageant sat to him for portraits with the most excellent result.</p>

<p>On their return to the Castle a few moments later the bride
and bridegroom were met by Queen Victoria and conducted
to the Green Drawing-Room, where the formal attestation of
the marriage took place.</p>

<p>It may be added that among those present at the marriage
and afterwards at the wedding breakfast were the Rev. H. M.
Birch and the Rev. C. F. Tarver, the Prince’s tutors, and when
lunch was over these gentlemen were informed that their old
pupil sent them a souvenir of himself, of which he desired their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
acceptance. This souvenir proved to be in each case a copy
of the Holy Scriptures, handsomely bound, and containing an
inscription in His Royal Highness’s own handwriting.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph by Hughes and Mullins</i></p>

</div>

<p>The wedding breakfast,
which was served in St.
George’s Hall, was very sumptuous,
but out of respect to
the Queen’s recent bereavement
there were not many
speeches&mdash;a circumstance which
probably did not greatly disappoint
either the bride or the
bridegroom. While the marriage
was actually in progress
the King of Denmark was
entertaining both the rich and
poor in his kingdom right
royally, and it must have been
a pleasant thought for the Princess
to know that her marriage
was filling with gladness innumerable
multitudes both of
her own people and of her
husband’s future subjects.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the Prince
and Princess took their departure
for Osborne, where a very short honeymoon was spent.
On their return home, which in this case meant Windsor, it was
noticed that the lovely bride looked the very picture of happiness.
The streets of Windsor were decorated with flags, and
the Royal borough looked as gay as it did on the wedding day.</p>

<p>After the marriage the Liturgy of the Church of England
was officially altered by the introduction of the name of the
Princess of Wales into the Prayer for the Royal Family. The
Scottish Church was also officially instructed to pray for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> “Her
Most Sacred Majesty Queen Victoria, Albert Edward Prince
of Wales, the Princess of Wales, and all the Royal Family.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">EARLY MARRIED LIFE</span></h2>

<p>At the outset of their married life King Edward and Queen
Alexandra were called upon to perform the public duties of the
Sovereign, which, since the Prince Consort’s death, had in
some measure necessarily developed upon the Duke of Cambridge
and his family. The late Duchess of Teck’s biographer
records that Society did its utmost to give the beautiful young
bride a right royal welcome. A memorable event of the
London season was the Guards’ ball in honour of the Prince
and Princess of Wales, held in the picture galleries of the
International Exhibition. The decorations were unusually
magnificent, and Queen Victoria graciously lent some splendid
plate from Buckingham Palace. Many members of the aristocracy,
too, placed at the disposal of the Duke of Cambridge,
as head of the Committee, their collections of gold and silver
plate, the contributions being valued at £2,000,000. The
guests, limited in number to 1400, began to arrive at nine
o’clock, and soon after ten the ball was opened by a royal
quadrille, in which eight couples took part, the Duke of
Cambridge dancing with the Princess of Wales, and the
Prince of Wales with Princess Mary (afterwards Duchess of
Teck). The Prince and Princess of Wales showed their
appreciation of the entertainment which their soldier hosts
had provided by remaining almost till dawn.</p>

<p>One of the first public appearances made by King Edward
after his marriage was at the Royal Academy dinner, where
he made an excellent short speech, greatly impressing those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
who were present by his modesty and good sense. Sir Charles
Eastlake was then President of the Royal Academy, and
Lady Eastlake gives this amusing account of the affair in
her reminiscences:&mdash;</p>

<p>“All went perfectly well at the Royal Academy dinner.
My husband was quite enchanted with the Prince of Wales,
and with his natural manners and simplicity. The Prince
hesitated in the middle of his speech, so that everybody
thought it was all up with him; but he persisted in thinking
till he recovered the thread, and then went on well. The
very manner in which he did this was natural and graceful.
He was so moved when mentioning his father that
it was feared he would break down. After the speech
the Prince turned to my husband and told him he was
quite provoked with himself. ‘I knew it quite by heart
in the morning’; but he evidently had no vanity, for he
laughed at his own ‘stupidity,’ and immediately recovered
his spirits. ‘Hesse’ was next the Prince, who chaffed him
from time to time, and told him he would have to sing a
song.”</p>

<p>William Makepeace Thackeray was among the other
speakers at the Academy dinner, which was very shortly before
the famous novelist’s lamented death. At the anniversary
of the Royal Literary Fund some months later King Edward
made some graceful and appropriate allusions to the great
writer whom the Empire had lost. He spoke with evident
feeling of the fact that Thackeray had been the life of the
Fund, always ready to open his purse for the relief of literary
men struggling with pecuniary difficulties.</p>

<p>This spring was a very busy time for both King Edward
and Queen Alexandra. On 8th June they were sumptuously
entertained by the Lord Mayor at the Guildhall, when the
Prince took up the freedom of the City, to which he was
entitled by patrimony. The entertainments included a great
ball, which the Princess opened, dancing a quadrille with the
Lord Mayor, while the Prince had the Lady Mayoress for his
partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later the Royal couple attended “Commem.” at
Oxford. They received a splendid welcome both from the
University authorities and the undergraduates. The honorary
degree of Doctor of Civil Law was conferred on King Edward
in the Sheldonian Theatre, where the wildest uproar prevailed,
till amid a sudden lull of perfect silence Queen Alexandra
entered with Dr. Liddell, the then Dean of Christ Church.
Scarcely had she traversed half the distance to her seat when
a cheer loud and deep arose, and seemed to shake the theatre
to its foundation, to the evident gratification of her Royal
husband.</p>

<p>After the ceremony was over their Royal Highnesses
escaped from all their friends and entertainers and took the
opportunity of going over what had been the Prince’s rooms
as an undergraduate. That same evening a ball was given in
the Prince’s honour in the Corn Exchange by the Apollo
Lodge of Freemasons.</p>

<p>Shortly after their visit to Oxford the Prince and Princess
celebrated their house-warming at Marlborough House by an
evening party and a ball. During the summer months they
spent some time at Sandringham in the original house, which
at that time stood in an isolated park, and which was afterwards
pulled down and superseded by the present very much larger
and more comfortable mansion. There can be no doubt that
Queen Alexandra’s strong affection for her country home is
based on the tender recollections of her early married life. It
is a significant fact that when the new Sandringham House
was built, she begged that her boudoir in the new mansion
might be arranged so as to be an exact reproduction of her
boudoir in the old house.</p>

<p>Among the very first visitors entertained at Sandringham
by the Royal bride and bridegroom was Dr. Stanley, who spent
Easter Sunday with them there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Alexandra in 1863</span></p>

<p><i>From the Painting by Lauchert, published by Colnaghi</i></p>

</div>

<p>“On the evening of Easter Eve,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> “the Princess
came to me in a corner of the drawing-room with her Prayer
Book, and I went through the Communion Service with her,
explaining the peculiarities and the likenesses and differences
to and from the Danish Service. She was most simple and
fascinating.… My visit to Sandringham gave me intense
pleasure. I was there for three days. I read the whole
Service, preached, then gave the first English Sacrament to
this ‘angel in the Palace.’ I saw a great deal of her, and can
truly say that she is as charming and beautiful a creature as
ever passed through a fairy tale.”</p>

<p>Much satisfaction was felt by the nation when the
interesting fact became known that Queen Victoria hoped
to welcome the first of her British grandchildren in the month
of March. One Friday evening, early in January, shortly
after Queen Alexandra, who was staying, had been skating on
Virginia Water, near Windsor, her eldest child appeared so
unexpectedly that for a while the Royal baby had to be
wrapped in cotton wool, for all the beautiful layette which was
in course of preparation was at Marlborough House.</p>

<p>The rejoicings over the event, both in this country and in
Denmark, were naturally very great, more especially when it
became known that the Royal infant was none the worse for
his early arrival. Among the two Royal families most immediately
concerned the interest and excitement were intense.
Princess Alice wrote to Queen Victoria on 9th January 1864,
“I was aghast on receiving Bertie’s telegram this morning
announcing the birth of their little son.” But this feeling of
trepidation quickly gave place to one of relief when the
bulletins announced the steady progress of both mother and
babe, and soon the British public saw many charming photographs
and portraits of Queen Alexandra in her new <i>rôle</i> of
mother. At the time of the birth of the Duke of Clarence
Queen Alexandra was not yet twenty, but, like Queen
Victoria, she seems to have been wholly absorbed in her
maternal duties, and at any moment she would joyfully give
up attending a State function or ball in order to spend an hour
in her nursery.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the first portion of the Prince
and Princess’s married life was overshadowed by the war
between Denmark and Prussia. The young Princess was
naturally strongly patriotic in her sympathies. At breakfast
one morning a foolish equerry read out a telegram which
announced a success of the Austro-Prussian forces, whereupon
Her Royal Highness burst into tears, and the Prince, it is said,
thoroughly lost his temper for once, and rated his equerry as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
soundly as his ancestor, King Henry VIII., might have done.
An amusing story went the round of the clubs about this time.
It was said that a Royal visitor at Windsor asked Princess
Beatrice what she would like for a present. The child stood
in doubt, and begged the Princess of Wales to advise her.
The result of a whispered conversation between the two was
that the little Princess declared aloud that she would like to
have Bismarck’s head on a charger!</p>

<p>In July 1864 the Prince laid the foundation-stone of the new
West Wing of the London Hospital. He was accompanied by
the Princess. This was one of the first occasions on which
King Edward showed his great interest in hospital management.
The fact that there was a separate ward for the Jews
aroused his keen interest. In the same month King Edward
and his Consort went to the Fourth of June at Eton, and also
stayed at Goodwood for the races. In the middle of August
they went to the Highlands, visiting Stirling Castle on the
way. They spent some weeks at Abergeldie, entertaining a
great deal. Dr. Norman Macleod stayed with them there.
It was during this stay in Scotland that the Prince and
Princess first became intimate with the family of their future
son-in-law, and the Countess of Fife, his mother, gave a great
picnic in their honour.</p>

<p>That autumn they went from Dundee to Denmark, being
accompanied by their baby, now nearly a year old. This
was King Edward’s first visit to his wife’s home. They
received a most enthusiastic welcome, and were splendidly
entertained. At Bernsdorf, where the Royal party spent
several days, a number of shooting parties were organised in
honour of the Prince, who, certainly for the first time in his life,
was invited to shoot foxes. He bagged two, and some of the
teeth of the animals were set as breast-pins for him.</p>

<p>From Elsinore the Prince and Princess went in their yacht
to Stockholm in order to pay a visit to the King and Queen of
Sweden. In Sweden also the Prince was invited to take part
in several hunting expeditions. One odd bag resulted in ten
foxes, six hares, and seventeen stags.</p>

<p>After sending Prince Albert Victor home with Countess
de Grey, the Royal couple travelled back <i>via</i> Germany and
Belgium, visiting on the way Prince and Princess Louis of
Hesse at Darmstadt, and making a short stay at Brussels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Then they came home for the rest of the autumn to Sandringham,
where Queen Alexandra spent her twentieth birthday.</p>

<p>The year 1865 proved an eventful one to both King Edward
and his wife. King Edward paid his first State visit to Ireland,
opening the International Exhibition of Dublin on 9th May,
and a little less than a month later Prince George of Wales was
born at Marlborough House.</p>

<p>Although there have at various times been more or less
serious fires in Royal residences, Sandringham, for instance,
having been almost destroyed by a conflagration within the
last few years, the King has only once been really in a fire, and
this was just a month after his second son’s birth. The fire
began in the floor then styled the nursery floor, and after
Queen Alexandra had been moved to another part of the house
with her two children, King Edward set to work with the
utmost energy to check the flames. It need hardly be said
that very soon the whole of London seemed to be congregated
in Pall Mall and St. James’s Park. At first it could not be
made out where the fire was coming from, and the King helped
to rip up the whole of the nursery floor before the mischief
could be traced, and while doing so he nearly had a bad accident,
for he fell some distance through the rafters.</p>

<p>At last, however, the fire was got under, and it was found
that comparatively little harm had been done. Then for the
first time it occurred to some one to ask if Marlborough House
was insured. Strangely enough this very important precaution
had not been taken. Now, however, both Marlborough House
and Sandringham are insured to their full value.</p>

<p>King Edward from childhood has always shown the keenest
interest in firemen and fires. During many years of his life he
used to be informed whenever a really big blaze was signalled,
and he has attended <i>incognito</i> most of the great London fires
during the last thirty years.</p>

<p><i>Photograph in 1864 by Vernon Heath, published by McQueen</i></p>

</div>

<p>About this time the King visited the gigantic steamship
<i>Great Eastern</i>, off Sheerness, in order to see the Atlantic telegraph
cable, which had just been completed. He was received
by a number of prominent engineers, and while he was present
the last section of the cable was being wound into the tanks
on board the <i>Great Eastern</i> from the vessel alongside which
had brought it from the works at Greenwich. A message was
sent through one of the coils, the length of which was equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to the distance from Sheerness to Valentia. The signals transmitted,
“God Save the Queen,” were received at the other
end of the coil in the course of a few seconds, a fact which,
commonplace as it may now seem, struck the onlookers in the
year 1865 with amazement. The King visited every portion
of the huge ship, and accepted specimen pieces of portions of
the cable in various stages of manufacture.</p>

<p>In that same year, that is two years after her marriage,
Queen Alexandra performed her first public act by opening the
Cambridge School of Art. It was in 1865 also that the King
attended his first public dinner as President of the Royal
Literary Fund, and on this occasion he toasted the ladies in
the following graceful words:&mdash;“In the presence of a society
accustomed to cultivating with such success the flowers of literature,
it would be unpardonable to forget the flowers of society.”</p>

<p>During that summer the Prince and Princess visited Cornwall,
and went down the Botallack tin mine, near St. Just, the
depth of which is about 200 fathoms. The bottom level of the
mine extends horizontally about half a mile beneath the sea.
A part of this mine then belonged to the Prince as Duke of
Cornwall. During the same tour he visited Land’s End. The
day was exceptionally clear and fine, and the Prince lingered
for some time among the grim rocks which form the western-most
point of England.</p>

<p>All this time Queen Victoria was living in the strictest
retirement, and the great shadow of the Prince Consort’s
death had thrown scarcely less gloom over the life of his
eldest son. King Edward mourned deeply for his father,
and it is significant that he never lost an opportunity of
testifying in his public speeches to the high purpose and
noble aims which had distinguished Prince Albert’s life. To
the cost of the mausoleum at Frogmore the King contributed
from his private purse no less a sum than £10,000. At the
end of 1865 he sustained another severe blow in the death of
Lord Palmerston, whom he had honoured with his special
friendship, and whom he had been accustomed to consult in his
private affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Not till February 1866 did Queen Victoria consent to
open Parliament again in person. She was accompanied by
the Prince of Wales and two of her daughters, the Princess
of Wales being accommodated with a seat on the Woolsack
facing the Throne.</p>

</div>

<p>It was in this year, when the Austro-German war was
going on, that King Edward established special telegraphic
communication between Marlborough House and the seat of
war. Like his lamented mother, he is a shrewd observer of
foreign politics, and now that he is
called upon to reign, he will be, as
she was, the greatest help to the
Foreign Minister of the day. He
has since kept up in every important
war the practice of securing the
earliest possible telegraphic information,
notably in the Franco-Prussian,
the Russo-Turkish, and the
Greco-Turkish wars, but most of
all in the Boer war.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1866 the King
laid the foundation-stone of the new
building of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, when he was received
by the venerable Earl of Shaftesbury,
President of the Society, the
Lord Mayor, the Archbishop of York, and the Bishop of
Winchester.</p>

<p>In his speech the King recalled the fact that only sixty-three
years previously Mr. Wilberforce had met with a few
friends in a small room in a dingy counting-house and had
established the Bible Society, while in the interval the Society
had already spent six millions of money in the furtherance of
its objects, and that it had contributed to the translation of the
Bible into two hundred and eighty different languages and
dialects. The King further said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>“I have an hereditary claim to be here on this occasion.
My grandfather, the Duke of Kent, warmly advocated the
claims of the Society, and it is gratifying to me to reflect
that the two modern versions of the Scriptures more widely
circulated than any others&mdash;the German and English&mdash;were
both in their origin connected with my family. The translation
of Martin Luther was executed under the protection of
the Elector of Saxony, the collateral ancestor of my lamented
father; whilst that of William Tyndale&mdash;the foundation of the
present Authorised English Version&mdash;was introduced with the
sanction of the Royal predecessor of my mother, the Queen
who first desired that ‘the Bible shall have free course
through all Christendom, but especially in my own realm.’
It is my hope and trust that, under the Divine guidance,
the wider diffusion and a deeper study of the Scriptures
will, in this as in every age, be at once the surest guarantee
of the progress and liberty of mind, and the means of multiplying
in the present form the consolations of our holy
religion.”</p>

<p>In the autumn following, King Edward and Queen Alexandra,
accompanied by their two sons, visited the Duke and
Duchess of Sutherland at Dunrobin. At that time the most
northern point of railway communication was at Ardgay, and
thence the King and Queen had to drive a distance of twenty-five
miles before they could reach Dunrobin Castle. All along
the route they received a most enthusiastic welcome. They
arrived at night at the Castle, and were received in Royal
Highland style. Among those asked to meet them were the
Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Saxe-Weimar, and many
members of the leading Scotch nobility. The King reviewed
the Sutherland Volunteers in the grounds of the Castle, and
later, on the same day, the Duke of Sutherland announced that
it was the wish of the King that the whole of the corps
should adopt the kilt as their uniform, His Majesty having
a preference for the national costume.</p>

<p>Shortly after their return from Scotland the King and
Queen had the pleasure of entertaining the Queen of Denmark
and her two younger children, and they spent some time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Sandringham with Queen Alexandra, while the King went to
Russia in order to be present at the marriage of his sister-in-law,
Princess Dagmar, to the then Cesarewitch. It was quite
late in the year, and it was considered that the cold in St.
Petersburg would be too severe for Queen Alexandra to
accompany her husband. The King, who attended the Imperial
marriage in his official capacity, was accompanied by a considerable
suite, including Lord Frederick Paulet, Viscount
Hamilton, the Marquis of Blandford, and Major Teesdale. On
his arrival at St. Petersburg he was met at the railway terminus
by the Emperor of Russia, the Cesarewitch, and the Grand
Dukes; and he was given splendid quarters at the Hermitage
Palace.</p>

<p>King Edward has always been known to have a great liking
for Russia and the Russian people, and he is himself very
popular in St. Petersburg. After the Imperial marriage he
visited Moscow, being accompanied by the Crown Prince of
Denmark. The Princes went over the Kremlin, and the
King paid a call on the Metropolitan Archbishop, the highest
dignitary of the Russian Church. The aged ecclesiastic received
him in a perfectly plain cell. They conversed for a quarter of
an hour, and as the King took his leave, the Metropolitan gave
him his blessing, and with the assistance of his monks accompanied
his Royal visitor to the door.</p>

<p>The year 1867 was, if not very eventful, an anxious one,
for both before and after the birth of Princess Louise, now the
Duchess of Fife, on 20th February, Queen Alexandra suffered
from acute rheumatism and inflammation of a knee-joint. Her
illness caused so much anxiety at the Danish Court that her
father and mother came over and spent some time in London.
King Edward was most devoted in his attentions to the invalid,
and actually had his bureau moved into her sick-room in order
that he might not be separated from her in her convalescence
even by the imperious demands of his enormous correspondence.
Happily Queen Alexandra grew quite strong again, but the
serious nature of her illness may be judged from the fact that
she was not able to drive out until 9th July. Naturally for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
rest of that year the King and Queen lived very quietly and
went about as little as possible.</p>

<p>Five years after their marriage the King and Queen paid
a visit to Ireland, and their reception was marked by a very
genuine demonstration of cordiality and even of enthusiasm.
On arriving in Kingstown Harbour Queen Alexandra was
presented, as Queen Victoria had been in 1849, with a white
dove, emblematic of the affection and goodwill which she was
supposed to be bringing to the distressful country. King
Edward, with his usual tact, declared it to be his wish that no
troops should be present in the streets of Dublin. Entire
reliance was accordingly placed on the loyalty and hospitable
spirit of the people, and, in spite of many doleful prognostications
to the contrary, the Royal visit was successful from every
point of view.</p>

<p>It has often been asserted that King Edward is fonder of
the Emerald Isle than is any other member of his family; he
certainly numbers several Irishmen among his closest friends.
Although he thoroughly enjoyed his visit, this one week in
1868 was one of the most tiring ever spent by the King.
Like his younger son, twenty-nine years later, the King was
installed with great pomp as a Knight of the Order of
St. Patrick, on which occasion he used the sword worn by
King George IV. The King also unveiled with much ceremony
a statue of Edmund Burke. The <i>Times</i> described the
exertions entailed by the Royal visit in the following vivid
passage:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>From a Painting by Weigall, published by Henry Graves and Co.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“There were presentations and receptions, and receiving
and answering addresses, processions, walking, riding and driving,
in morning and evening, military, academic, and medieval
attire. The Prince had to breakfast, lunch, dine, and sup, with
more or less publicity, every twenty-four hours. He had to go
twice to races, with fifty or a hundred thousand people about
him; to review a small army and make a tour in the Wicklow
mountains, of course everywhere receiving addresses under
canopies and dining in State under galleries full of spectators.
He visited and inspected institutions, colleges, universities,
academies, libraries, and cattle shows. He had to take a very
active part in assemblies of from several hundred to several
thousand dancers, and always to select for his partners the
most important personages.… He had to listen to many
speeches sufficiently to know when and what to answer. He
had to examine with respectful interest, pictures, books, antiquities,
relics, manuscripts, specimens, bones, fossils, prize
beasts, and works of Irish art. He had never to be unequal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to the occasion, however different from the last, or however
like the last, and whatever his disadvantage as to the novelty
or dulness of the matter and the scene.”</p>

<p>Some amusing incidents happened. A loyal Irish girl,
determined to have a good look at her future King and Queen,
defied all rails and barriers, and, mounted on horseback,
dashed through the crowd of sightseers and galloped past the
Royal visitors, exclaiming, “Oh, thank you all, I have seen
them and shall go home happy now.” King Edward, with a
smile, raised his hat, which was certainly the most sensible
thing he could have done in the circumstances.</p>

<p>The King has always shown great interest in Ireland and
Irish matters, so much so that it has been more than once
whispered that he is a Home Ruler. He gave his warm
support and help to a fund for the relief of distress in Ireland,
and more recently, during the annual Show of the Royal
Agricultural Society, he took the opportunity to receive and
entertain at Sandringham no fewer than three hundred and
fifty Irish tenant-farmers.</p>

<p>On their way back from Dublin the Prince and Princess of
Wales visited North Wales, and on landing at Holyhead they
passed along the pier through a double line of aged Welshwomen,
who were all wearing the tall hat and national dress of
the Principality. At Carnarvon the Prince inaugurated some
new waterworks, and after this ceremony the Royal party
proceeded to the famous castle, where they were presented
with an address from the Council of the National Eisteddfod.
The Prince replied in a neat little speech, in which he observed
that he and the Princess received the address with peculiar
satisfaction on the anniversary of the birth, on 25th April
1284, and in the very birthplace, of the first Prince of Wales,
“Edward of Carnarvon,” the son of Edward I.</p>

<p>King Edward’s fourth child, the Princess Victoria, was
born on 6th July, and after a quiet summer spent at Sandringham
the King and Queen, attended by a small suite, left
Marlborough House in November for a long Continental tour,
which extended over some months and enabled them to renew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
old ties and make new friendships. They spent a few days in
Paris, and paid a visit to the Emperor and Empress of the
French at Compiègne, where, during a stag hunt organised in
honour of King Edward, an accident happened which might
easily have cost him his life. As he was galloping along one
of the grassy drives of the forest, a stag rushed from one of the
cross-paths and knocked
him and his horse completely
over. Fortunately
he was not hurt, though
much bruised and shaken.
Without alarming those
about him, he again mounted
and went on hunting to the
end of the day. At this
house-party the King and
Queen had as fellow-guests
Marshal Bazaine, Count
von Moltke, and a number
of other notable people
destined to make history.</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra’s
birthday, 1st December,
was spent in Denmark.
After a short stay there
the travellers went to Berlin,
where a large family
party was assembled to meet them, and on 18th January,
which is, curiously enough, one of the only two days of the
year in which it can be held, a Chapter of the Order of the
Black Eagle was convened, and King Edward was formally
invested with the insignia of this, the highest Order in
Germany, by the King of Prussia, to whom he was introduced
by his brother-in-law, the Crown Prince, and by Prince Albert
of Prussia.</p>

<p>Then followed an interesting sojourn in Vienna, where the
Royal party were splendidly entertained by the Emperor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Empress of Austria, a suite of apartments in the Burg having
been specially prepared for them.</p>

<p>These Continental visits, however, were all preliminary to
a prolonged tour in Egypt and the Mediterranean, which must
be described in a separate chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THEIR MAJESTIES’ TOUR IN EGYPT AND THE MEDITERRANEAN</span></h2>

<p>Of this tour Queen Alexandra’s Bedchamber Woman, the
Hon. Mrs. Grey, wrote a charming record, which her brother-in-law,
General Grey, persuaded her to give to the world. It
should be mentioned that Mrs. Grey was a Swedish lady, the
daughter of Count Stedingk. Her first husband, the Hon.
William George Grey, eighth son of the famous Earl Grey
who was Prime Minister in the reign of William IV., had
been dead some years before this tour began. She afterwards
married <i>en secondes noces</i> the Duke of Otranto, but it will be
more convenient to speak of her here as Mrs. Grey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grey begins by giving an outline of her plans for the
summer of 1868, and then goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“These plans were, however, all upset by a letter from the
Princess, in which she told me that she wished me to accompany
her on the tour she projected with the Prince of Wales to
the East, and to join her at Copenhagen in the beginning of
January; and that in the meantime I might remain quietly&mdash;which
she knew would be a pleasure to me&mdash;with my father
and mother in Sweden. This was too tempting an offer not to
be eagerly embraced.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grey went to Copenhagen, and there writes in her
journal at the beginning of 1869 the following sketch of the
tour:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>“<i>January 12.</i>&mdash;Soon after breakfast I went to see my dear
Princess, and to hear something of the proposed plans. I
found her, as usual, most kind and affectionate, but very sorry
that the few weeks she had been able to spend with her father
and mother had come to an end. Her visit seemed to have
been a great happiness to her. It is now arranged that we
shall set out for our long journey on the 15th, and that while I
accompany Her Royal Highness as her lady-in-waiting, Lady
Carmarthen and Colonel Keppel, who accompanied the Prince
and Princess from England in November, shall part from us at
Hamburg, and, with Sir W. Knollys, take the Royal children
home. The plan is for us to pass by Berlin and Vienna, and
embark on board the <i>Ariadne</i> frigate, fitted as a yacht, at
Trieste; sail from thence to Alexandria; and, after going up
the Nile as far as the Second Cataract, to visit Constantinople,
the Crimea, and Greece, before returning home somewhere
about the beginning of May. Such is the plan made out for
us, but it is, of course, open to many changes, as the political
state of things between Greece and Turkey at the present
moment may, after all, very possibly upset the latter part of
the journey; and in that case we shall return home through
Italy.”</p>

<p>King Edward and Queen Alexandra were joined at Trieste
by Prince Louis of Battenberg, the Duke of Sutherland, Dr.
(afterwards Sir) W. H. Russell, and other friends, together
with their suite. There the Royal party embarked on board
H.M.S. <i>Ariadne</i>, which had been specially fitted up for their
reception. Of the accommodation in this vessel Mrs. Grey
gives an attractive account:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The <i>Ariadne</i>, in reality a man-of-war, but for this occasion
fitted up as a yacht, is most comfortable. The Prince and
Princess have two large sleeping cabins, besides a large cabin
for a sitting-room, and another for a dining-room. I have a
charming cabin also, with a bath-room outside, and my maid
next door to me. In short, I think we were all much pleased
with the accommodation and arrangement of what is to be our
<i>home</i>, while at sea, for the next four months.”</p>

<p>The travellers reached Alexandria on 3rd February 1869, and
were met by the usual loyal greetings, addresses, and bouquets
presented by the British residents. The party then went on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Cairo, where they were received by the Viceroy of Egypt and
his ministers. Here the King and Queen were assigned a
palace, which Mrs. Grey thus describes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Palace of Esbekieh is beautiful, full of French luxury,
but without the real comfort of an English house. The Prince
and Princess have an immense bedroom, full of rich French
furniture. The beds are very beautiful, made of massive
silver, and cost, I believe, £3000 each! My room is so large
that even when the candles are lit, there might be somebody
sitting at the other end of it without your knowing it. You
could not even hear people speaking from one end to the other!
It is as high as it is long, with nine large windows. There is a
beautiful silver bed, a large divan (rather high and hard for
comfort) round half of the room, a common writing-table and
washhand-stand (put in all the rooms at the request of Sir S.
Baker), a large sofa, and quantities of very smart chairs round
the walls. The curtains and covers of the furniture are all
made of the richest silk. Add to all this, one immense looking-glass,
and you have the whole furniture of my room, which is
more like a State drawing-room at Windsor than a bedroom.
All the other rooms are furnished in the same way.”</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra and Mrs. Grey had an absolutely novel
experience on 5th February, namely an invitation to dinner at
the Harem of “La Grande Princesse,” the Viceroy’s mother.</p>

<p>The Queen, her lady-in-waiting, and two English ladies
were received at the door of the Palace by la Grande Princesse,
the second and third wife of the Viceroy (the first and fourth
were not well), his eldest son, and two eldest daughters. La
Grande Princesse took Queen Alexandra by the hand, while
one of the wives handed Mrs. Grey, another Mrs. Stanton
(wife of the British Consul), and one of the daughters Miss
M’Lean; and so the party went in procession to an immense
drawing-room, the whole way thither being lined with slaves.
No stay, however, was made in the drawing-room, and what
followed reads like a page out of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.</p>

<p>The visitors were conducted straight to the dining-room,
after having a cherry given them to eat, handed to them on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
beautiful gold tray, with goblets and plates of gold and precious
stones. A slave then offered each visitor a silver basin to
wash their hands in before sitting down to dinner. In the
middle of the room there was a kind of round silver table,
about one foot high from the floor, looking more like a big
tray than anything else; large square cushions were placed
all round it, and the company sat down <i>à la Turque</i> round the
table, la Grande Princesse having Queen Alexandra on her
right, next whom was Mehemet Taafik Pasha, then the third
Princess and Mrs. Grey, with the second Princess next, on
the left side of the Viceroy’s mother. Mrs. Stanton and Miss
M’Lean, with the two daughters of the Viceroy, dined in
another room.</p>

<p>A slave then entered very smartly dressed, half her skirt
being of black satin and embroidered in gold, and the other
half of yellow satin, also trimmed with gold, and with a sort of
turban on her head. She had a beautifully embroidered napkin,
with gold fringe, hanging on her arm, as a sort of badge of
her office, which corresponded with that of a European
<i>maître-d’hôtel</i>. She placed each dish in the middle of the
table, beginning with soup&mdash;a sort of chicken broth with rice.
Each visitor was given a sort of tortoiseshell spoon, with a
large coral branch as a handle, but neither knife nor fork; and
then, at a sign from the old Princess, everybody dipped their
spoons into the tureen together. Next came an enormous
piece of mutton, of which the company had to tear off bits
with their fingers and put them straight into their mouths.
About twenty dishes followed in rapid succession, alternately
savoury and sweet, and the dinner ended with <i>compôte</i> of
cherries. No wine or water was served during the meal, and
Mrs. Grey confesses that she felt thoroughly disgusted.</p>

<p>Some very necessary washing of hands followed, and then
there was an entertainment in the great drawing-room, given
by musicians and dancing-girls, in the course of which a slave
brought in a tray covered with black velvet cloth embroidered
with pearls and uncut emeralds, and decorated with an enormous
diamond star in the centre. This was lifted off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
then were revealed a number of cups encrusted with diamonds,
and full of coffee. These were handed round, and a slave
brought pipes and cigarette-holders, all lavishly ornamented
with precious stones, each mouthpiece being formed of one
large ruby or emerald.</p>

<p>After an interval the visitors were taken all through the
upper rooms, a young prince who acted as interpreter being
most anxious that Queen Alexandra should see everything.
“La Princesse doit tout voir,” he kept saying. More music
and dancing followed, and more coffee, until at four o’clock it
seemed to be time to go, so Queen Alexandra rose, and the
party were handed out to the door of the garden at which they
had entered amid enthusiastic demonstrations of affection on
the part of their hospitable entertainers.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt of the impression which the Queen’s
graciousness and charm created. Mrs. Grey says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“They were all perfectly enchanted with the Princess, and
about every ten or fifteen minutes <i>une phrase de cérémonie</i> was
exchanged through the Prince [that is, the young Egyptian
prince who acted as interpreter]. ‘La Grande Princesse est si
contente de vous voir,’ or ‘La Grande Princesse regrette tant
que cela soit contre l’usage du pays, de vous rendre cette
visite’; and so on.… At last they all expressed a hope that
the Princess would come and dine again on her return to
Cairo.”</p>

<p>The same evening Queen Alexandra had the pleasure of
visiting some beautiful Arab horses in the stables of Ali Sherif
Pasha.</p>

<p>Before starting on their journey up the Nile the King and
Queen took the opportunity of witnessing the curious and
interesting Procession of the Holy Carpet starting from Cairo
on its way to Mecca, which, strangely enough, few of the
Europeans who at that time visited Cairo cared to see. Every
year two carpets are sent, one of which goes to Medina to
serve as a covering for the tomb of the Prophet, and the other
to Mecca to be a covering for Kaabah or the central point of
the Mahomedan religion. The King and Queen also witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the departure of the pilgrims for Mecca, or rather of that
portion of the pilgrimage consisting of sheikhs and holy men,
escorted by irregular cavalry and artillery, which left the city
to join the other pilgrims encamped on the plain outside.</p>

<p>On 6th February the voyage up the Nile began. The
party was a large one, and the number of vessels provided for
them formed quite a little fleet, of which the following was the
order of sailing:&mdash;</p>

<p>A large and very smartly fitted-up steamer, the <i>Federabanee</i>,
Captain Achmet Bey, headed the squadron, and was occupied
by Prince Louis of Battenberg (then a midshipman on board
the <i>Ariadne</i>), Major Teesdale, Captain Ellis, equerries in
waiting, Lord Carrington, Mr. O. Montagu, Dr. Minter, Sir
Samuel Baker, and Mr. Brierley. On deck there was a large
saloon, all fitted up with silk and looking-glasses and every
description of luxury, and there meals were served. Outside
this there was a small open saloon with a large looking-glass at
the back, in which the scenery could be viewed in comfort.</p>

<p>The <i>Federabanee</i> towed a most beautiful dahabeah, or Nile
boat, which was named the <i>Alexandra</i>, and in which the
King and Queen and Mrs. Grey lived. It was all fitted up in
blue and gold, with a great deal of taste, and the cabins were
all large and most comfortable. Mrs. Grey mentions that
the King and Queen had “a very nice sleeping cabin, with
a bath-room and dressing-room apiece.” The <i>Alexandra</i> also
contained a large sitting-room with a piano, and outside there
was a place for sitting and reading, as well as the upper deck.
The only inconvenience of this arrangement was that the
travellers in the dahabeah had to go on board the <i>Federabanee</i>
for every meal. This necessity was especially hard on Queen
Alexandra, who resolved, however, to return to the dahabeah
after breakfast as often as she could in order to have time for
painting and reading; this, with the active co-operation of Mrs.
Grey, she contrived to do on a good many days.</p>

<p>After the dahabeah came a kitchen steamer, carrying four
French cooks and one Arab cook, and towing a barge full of
provisions and live stock, such as turkeys, sheep, and chickens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Following this came another steamer, having on board Colonel
Stanton, British Consul-General at Cairo, with two Egyptian
gentlemen, Mourad Pasha and Abd El Kader Bey, and towing
a barge containing horses, donkeys, and a French washerwoman.
Nor was this all. In his anxiety to do everything possible for
the comfort of the Royal party, the Viceroy had actually provided
another steamer of lighter draft than the <i>Federabanee</i>,
simply in case the latter vessel should get stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>The whole flotilla was completed by a steamer belonging to
the Duke of Sutherland, the father of the present Duke, who
brought with him a distinguished party, composed of his son,
Lord Stafford, Colonel Marshall, Dr. Russell, Mr. Sumner,
Professor Owen, Mr. Fowler, the distinguished engineer,
Major Alison, the Duke’s brother Lord A. Gower, and Sir
Henry Pelly.</p>

<p>The King looked forward to having plenty of sport during
the voyage. Accordingly he had taken a large variety of
guns of almost every calibre in use, as well as a wherry to be
used for approaching land game. For the purpose of capturing
crocodiles, nets were brought which had been specially made
under the superintendence of Sir Samuel Baker. The King
also specially arranged for the inclusion in his party of a clever
naturalist and taxidermist.</p>

<p>Both the King and Queen greatly enjoyed this novel form
of yachting, although, unfortunately, bad weather soon set in,
and the <i>Alexandra</i> was frequently enveloped in clouds of dust
and sand. Notwithstanding this, however, the King had
fairly good sport and bagged some very large birds, though
the crocodiles were, on the whole, conspicuous by their
absence. Soon the Royal taxidermist could show some very
fine specimens of spoonbills, flamingoes, herons, cranes,
cormorants, and doves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grey thus records an amusing adventure which
happened on 9th February:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>“The fog was so thick this morning that we could not
start till nine o’clock, the hour at which we are in future
usually to begin our day’s voyage being between five and six
in the morning; and then to go on, with occasional stoppages,
till six in the evening. We now only went on for about an
hour, as the Prince wanted to try and shoot some ducks from a
small punt with a large gun, which had been lent to him for
the trip. At eleven, the Princess and myself, with Prince
Battenberg, Sir S. Baker, Mr. Brierley, and Dr. Minter,
followed in another boat to look at the shooting. We saw
perfect swarms of wild ducks, and hundreds of flamingoes
and a few pelicans. However, the ducks took fright, and only
a few flamingoes were shot. We determined to land, as soon
as we saw that we could no longer spoil the sport; but the
water being low, we stuck fast in the sand about thirty or
forty yards from the shore. The four boatmen at once took
off their jackets, shoes, and trousers; but luckily some undergarments
(waistcoats and trousers in one) remained; and in
they jumped, and dragged the boat a few yards, beyond which
their utmost efforts were unable to move it. The alternative
was now either to remain in the boat or to allow ourselves to
be carried through the water. Of course we chose the latter.
Sir S. Baker and Mr. Brierley carried the Princess, crossing
their arms, on which she sat.”</p>

<p>Ultimately the whole party got off and reached Minieh.
There the King joined a shooting party on the following day,
while the Queen, Prince Louis of Battenberg, and some of the
others visited the Viceroy’s palace, and afterwards saw the
process of making sugar out of the sugar-canes. Queen
Alexandra and Mrs. Grey were allowed to visit the wife of
one of the directors of the sugar factory, whom Mrs. Grey
describes as a very ugly woman, painted and bedizened. The
room was full of her women friends, all as ugly and as lavishly
dressed as she was. Queen Alexandra, however, was much
pleased with the novelty of such a visit, for, though the
hostess and her friends were very cheerful and talked and
laughed, yet naturally everything that was said was quite
unintelligible to their English visitors. The Queen afterwards
sent some presents to the ladies in memory of the
visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th the Queen and Mrs. Grey succeeded in
staying for the whole day in the dahabeah, where they
played and wrote and painted. The same thing happened
on the afternoon of the 13th, the morning being occupied by
an interesting lecture from Mr. Fowler on the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>During the voyage Queen Alexandra had one very serious
adventure. One night the King, who was on board the steamer,
observed a light reflected on the side of the <i>Alexandra</i>. He at
once gave an alarm, the Queen and Mrs. Grey, who were in
the dahabeah, were hurried off to the shore, and the fire, which
had been caused by a lighted candle in Prince Louis of
Battenberg’s cabin, was put out by the King and his suite.
Had not the quick eye of the King discovered the danger a
terrible disaster might have happened, for the boats were
wooden and scorched by an Egyptian sun, while there were,
of course, a considerable number of cartridges on board.</p>

<p>The 14th was Sunday, the first Sunday in Lent, and Mrs.
Grey records that King Edward read the service to the party
and the servants very impressively. The party frequently
landed to visit the temples and the other splendid ruins of
ancient Egyptian civilisation. On one occasion the King
caught a bat in the large tomb of Rameses IV.</p>

<p>The party started to see the Temple of Karnak by moonlight
on the evening of the 18th. The King rode a milk-white
ass caparisoned in crimson velvet and gold, while the Queen
was mounted on a gray mule. When they approached the
temple an electric light was lit between each enormous
column, and in the background there was a display of rockets
and fireworks, forming stars of different colours. This had
been arranged by the King as a surprise for the Queen,
though Mrs. Grey confesses that the secret had been accidentally
revealed. However, she describes the whole scene as
one of surprising beauty. She walked alone with the Queen
amid the gigantic columns, until they were recalled to the
prosaic luxury of the nineteenth century by being offered
glasses of iced champagne.</p>

<p>The 20th was rendered memorable by a mishap; all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
steamers stuck fast in the ground, with the result that everybody
had to turn out, and all the luggage had to be removed
in order to lighten the boats. The King and Queen and Mrs.
Grey were entertained on board the Duke of Sutherland’s
steamer at dinner, and by the next day the difficulty of the
sand-banks had been surmounted, thanks to the smaller steamer
which the Viceroy’s foresight had provided.</p>

<p>On the 21st the King again read Divine Service, and the
party arrived at Assouan. Here they found a large number
of camels ready to carry the baggage across from the First
Cataract to Philæ, whither the party rode to see the boats
in which they were to go on to the Second Cataract. On the
22nd the King started first in order to pay a visit to Lady
Duff Gordon, who was living in her dahabeah a little above
Assouan; while the Queen, the Duke of Sutherland, and Mrs.
Grey followed in a boat to the foot of the First Cataract,
where they were to meet the King. There seems to have
been some hitch in the arrangements, but Queen Alexandra
was not at all disconcerted, and was highly amused at having
to ride a wretched donkey without a bridle, and with a cushion
for a saddle, though Mrs. Grey, who was no better mounted,
regarded the incident with less philosophy. After a time,
however, they met their own donkeys, and ultimately joined
the King’s party, who had been getting very anxious.</p>

<p>The Duke of Sutherland and his party left on the 23rd,
while the Royal party continued their voyage in two new
dahabeahs tied together, and towed by a small steamer. The
accommodation was not nearly so good as it had been below
Philæ. The Queen and Mrs. Grey landed frequently, and the
latter notes that her Royal mistress found great pleasure in
distributing the <i>baksheesh</i> for which the natives were continually
asking, especially the little children. On one occasion the
Queen and her lady-in-waiting found a donkey running about;
they caught it, and the Queen mounted it and rode through
the fields in the cleverest way without saddle or bridle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King was very anxious for crocodile, but
he had very poor luck, though he had better sport with fishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
It was not, indeed, until the 28th that he had a fair shot at a
crocodile, which he killed at fifty yards with his first barrel.
The excitement was tremendous among the party, for, as is
well known, the shyness of these beasts is so great that they
are among the most difficult game to stalk in the world. This
specimen was 9 feet long and 4 feet round the body; and it
was at once skinned with a view to being stuffed. Inside the
creature was found a quantity of pebbles, two bottles full of
which were brought away as mementoes.</p>

<p>The King and Queen throughout the voyage took the
greatest interest in the antiquities along the route, visiting
all that were accessible. Mrs. Grey mentions how much Queen
Alexandra enjoyed the extreme peacefulness of the life led
by the party, for there was no post nor any papers, and, after
the first inconvenience had worn off, the feeling that no means
existed of either sending or receiving letters soon became
perfectly delightful.</p>

<p>A touching incident occurred at Wady Halfa on 3rd March.
The party were at dinner, when the King and Queen took a
fancy to a little boy whom they saw watching the torches, which
were always fixed in the ground on shore wherever the Royal
dahabeah stopped for the night. On being questioned, the
child said that his father was dead, his mother had married
again, and he had not a friend in the world. He was delighted
with the idea of going with the party, and so he was engaged
as a pipe cleaner. The only property he had was a white linen
shirt and a white cap. Mrs. Grey describes him as an intelligent
ugly little boy, not very black, but rather bronzed,
and wearing a large silver ring in one ear.</p>

<p>Whenever the dahabeah stopped, numbers of natives came
down to the bank, mostly children; and at first the Queen
used to throw them bread and oranges, but it was discovered
that they regarded empty bottles as much more valuable, and
for these there was the greatest competition, although in the
end they generally agreed to divide the spoil equally in the
most good-humoured manner. At one place a little Nubian
monkey was presented to Queen Alexandra, and the fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
donor was presented in return with a double-barrelled English
fowling-piece and some money.</p>

<p>There were the usual groundings on sand-banks, but nothing
else of interest occurred, and the party returned to their old
dahabeah on 8th March, having thoroughly enjoyed their expedition
to the Second Cataract. After lunch the King and Queen,
with Mrs. Grey and Sir Samuel Baker, paid a visit to Lady
Duff Gordon in the dahabeah, which she had made entirely her
home on account of her health.</p>

<p>The return voyage down the Nile began on the following
day, and immediately the big steamer stuck fast on the old
sand-bank which gave so much trouble on the way up, although
the Viceroy had had six hundred people working away in the
interval to deepen the channel. No amount of exertion could
get the steamer off, and consequently the little steamer was
used, and Prince Louis of Battenberg, Sir Samuel Baker, and
Lord Carrington had to sleep on deck.</p>

<p>On 10th March, the anniversary of the King and Queen’s
wedding day, some members of the Duke of Sutherland’s party,
which had broken up, met the Royal party at Thebes, namely,
Colonel Stanton, Sir Henry Pelly, Major Alison, and Abd El
Kader Bey. Colonel Stanton entertained the party, and
Mourad Pasha proposed the health of the Royal pair. After
dinner the party went to the house of Mustapha Aga, the
English Consul, where they saw some famous Egyptian dancing-girls,
including the Taglioni of the country, and some remarkable
mummy cases, which had been excavated on purpose for
the King. The following day they visited the spot where the
digging was going on. Mrs. Grey describes it as like a coal
pit, at the bottom of which was a magnificent stone sarcophagus,
said to be that of the beautiful Queen Nicotris, which the King
intended to take to England, together with a selection of
mummies.</p>

<p>This was the last day’s picnic on the Nile, and the party
were due at Minieh in two days, going thence by rail to Cairo.
On the 15th, however, the Queen, Mrs. Grey, and some of the
gentlemen of the party paid a visit to the little town of Minieh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
where an old woman was engaged to tell fortunes. This she
did with the aid of a heap of shells and bits of coloured glass;
and she told the Queen that she had many friends and much
money, with the usual “patter” traditional among fortune-tellers.
Thence the party went on to the house of the
Governor of the town, where a kind of lemonade was offered
to the visitors, and the Queen was presented with a beautiful
white parrot and two live flamingoes. The menagerie already
consisted of the Nubian monkey, a snapping turtle, and two
goats. As for the little Nubian boy, who was added to the
party at Wady Halfa, he turned out much too sharp and difficult
to manage, so, instead of bringing him to England, the King
decided to start him in life with a donkey, as one of the
numerous donkey boys so common in Egypt.</p>

<p>On 16th March the party went by train from Minieh
to Ghizeh, where they were met by the Viceroy’s eldest son
and a number of officials. After some conversation the King
and Queen took their leave, and the Royal party, entering some
carriages, drove to the Pyramids. At the foot of the big
Pyramid they found a small pavilion which had been built on
purpose for the Royal visit. The King and Queen, in spite of
the slippery, difficult, and suffocating ascent, visited the King’s
and Queen’s chambers, and the King actually went up to the
top of the Pyramid. Dinner was served in the pavilion by
order of the Viceroy, consisting of nineteen dishes, eight
entrées, ice, and other luxuries&mdash;quite a small dinner for Egypt.</p>

<p>On the night drive to Cairo which followed, there was very
nearly a bad accident, the carriage being driven up against a
high white flag-post, which it fortunately only just touched.</p>

<p>During the voyage down the Nile the King received
letters to say that as the differences between Turkey and
Greece had been happily settled, their Majesties were free to
pay their proposed visit to Constantinople and Athens.</p>

<p>The King and Queen spent a week in Cairo, and saw all
the sights of that wonderful city, which were then, it must be
remembered, much more novel than they are nowadays when
Egypt has become a regular winter resort. Mrs. Grey gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
an amusing description of a shopping expedition on which she
attended Queen Alexandra in the Turkish bazaar. Abd El
Kader Bey, their old friend of the Nile expedition, did the
bargaining in the Oriental method. The Queen wished to
buy a burnous, but the price was too high, and so Abd El
Kader Bey sent for a shopman from another shop where they
had seen a similar burnous, and employed him to help in
bargaining with the other shopman. This extraordinary
device was most successful, and the Queen ultimately obtained
her burnous for £9.</p>

<p>On the 19th Mrs. Grey attended the Queen in the ordeal
of being photographed on a dromedary, and then the party,
having been joined by the King, went to see the museum of
Egyptian antiquities, where the distinguished French Egyptologist,
M. Mariette, explained everything. In the evening of
the same day there was a great dinner at the Viceroy’s palace
on the other side of the river, where the scene was one of truly
Oriental magnificence and luxury, finishing up with a display
of fireworks so arranged that their reflection was seen in a large
ornamental piece of water.</p>

<p>The Royal party had intended to leave Cairo on the 21st
March, but the King was persuaded by the Viceroy to remain
over the Feast of Bairam, which corresponds with the Christian
Easter. Consequently, instead of starting immediately, the
Queen, to her great delight, was able to pay a visit to the wife
of Mourad Pasha, who had attended so ably to the comfort of
the Royal travellers during their voyage on the Nile. Queen
Alexandra was delighted with this lady, who was most kind
and good-natured, and spoke French very well, her father,
indeed, having been half a Frenchman.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the Queen started after breakfast for the
bazaars, and met the King there and shopped until lunch-time.
In the afternoon the Queen and Mrs. Grey visited the wife of
Abd El Kader Bey, and then went on to see Achmet Bey, the
captain of their dahabeah. His wife received the English
visitors with much enthusiasm, kissing both the Queen and
Mrs. Grey violently. Mrs. Achmet was a very pretty woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with pleasant manners, but although she could only speak
Arabic, which was not understood by her visitors, yet she
never stopped talking for a minute.</p>

<p>The following day, the 23rd, was the first day of Bairam,
and the Queen again visited la Grande Princesse, the Viceroy’s
mother, who held a sort of Drawing-room in the Harem. In the
evening the Queen went to the Viceroy’s palace across the river
to dine with His Highness’s four wives. The Princesses were
much charmed with some photographs which the Queen gave
them of herself. Shortly before leaving she expressed a wish
to see how the Egyptian ladies’ outdoor veils were fastened on.
Some were accordingly sent for, and Queen Alexandra was
dressed up in a veil, much to her amusement; her eyebrows,
and those of Mrs. Grey, were painted, and the thin veil and
the burnous were put over them. These Her Majesty and her
lady-in-waiting were entreated to keep as a <i>souvenir</i> of their
visit. They were still wearing their Egyptian dresses when
they returned to their palace, but to their great disappointment
found everybody gone to bed except their courier, whom they
succeeded in surprising, though he very frankly said that he
thought the ladies were looking far better than usual. That
was the last night in Cairo.</p>

<p>On the following day the Royal party had a very hot and
dusty journey, and arrived at Suez at seven o’clock in the
evening. There they were joined by Dr. Russell and Major
Alison, and were met by the great de Lesseps. Dinner was
served in the large dining-room of the hotel, and among the
waiters the King observed a small black boy about fourteen
years old, who seemed intelligent above the average. After
dinner His Majesty asked the landlord of the hotel about
him, and, finding that he was an Abyssinian boy and had an
excellent character, he decided to take him home instead of
the little <i>mauvais sujet</i> whom the party had picked up at
Wady Haifa.</p>

<p>Then came one of the most interesting episodes of the tour,
namely, their visit to the Suez Canal, where their Majesties
were received and escorted by M. de Lesseps. The works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the Canal Company were by no means completed, but they
were being actively carried forward, a large dock, 450 feet
long, having been already finished. At Tussum the King
performed the important ceremony of opening the sluices of
the dam across the finished portion of the canal, thus letting
the waters of the Mediterranean into the empty basin of the
Bitter Lakes.</p>

<p>The Royal party then drove about three miles beyond the
town through the desert to the Viceroy’s <i>châlet</i>, a pretty little
place built on high ground overlooking Lake Timsah. The
King and Queen were lodged here, the rest of the party having
to rough it in out-houses and tents. Dinner was served in a
large tent, and, thanks to the Viceroy’s forethought, it was a
most excellent French dinner, for His Highness was determined
that his guests should not have to rough it unless it was
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The next day the Royal party went up the Canal towards
the Mediterranean, and after driving through Port Said, they
embarked on board the Viceroy’s yacht <i>Mahroussa</i> for passage
to Alexandria. M. de Lesseps and his party also came on
board the yacht. When the vessel passed outside the breakwater
she began to roll so much that dinner became more
exciting than comfortable. One swell threw everything off
the table, and the Royal party were rolled out of their chairs,
and then in an instant, before they had time to pick themselves
up, another roll threw the ship over on the other side. Fortunately,
however, the rolling did not last very long, and the
resources of the yacht were so great that dinner was not long
interrupted.</p>

<p>The following morning the yacht arrived at Alexandria,
where the Royal party visited the various sights, including
Cleopatra’s Needle and Pompey’s Pillar. Then they were
rowed off in a barge to the <i>Ariadne</i>, their old home, which
looked quite small and poor after the gorgeous <i>Mahroussa</i>,
with its silk hangings, Italian marbles, mosaic mother-of-pearl,
and so on, though in reality it was much more comfortable in
a practical way. Here they said good-bye, much to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
regret, to Mourad Pasha, Abd El Kader Bey, and old Captain
Achmet, as well as to Colonel Stanton, the British Consul.</p>

<p>The next day, 28th March, the <i>Ariadne</i> left for Constantinople,
but nothing much of importance occurred during the
voyage, and the vessel anchored on 1st April some three miles
from Constantinople. There the Royal party were transferred
to the Sultan’s yacht <i>Pertif Piati</i>, in which they went past
the entrance to the Golden Horn, as far as the Saleh-Bazar
Palace, which had been assigned as a residence by the Sultan
to the King and Queen during their visit. The Sultan himself
received the Royal party on landing, and took Queen
Alexandra up to her rooms, every one following.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grey describes the rooms in the Saleh-Bazar Palace
as not quite so gorgeous as those which they had had at Cairo,
but, on the other hand, fitted up with the most perfect taste in
the French style. Every European luxury had been provided.
The lattice work, which is always put up across the windows in
Turkish houses in order to screen the fair inmates from the
rude gaze of outsiders, had been removed and replaced with
magnificent silk hangings. All the servants appointed to wait
on the King and Queen were Greek and European, except the
coachmen, who were French. The meals at the Palace were
all served on gold and silver plate studded with gems; a band
of eighty-four musicians played during dinner; every morning
arrived gorgeous presents from the Sultan, including exquisite
flowers and trays laden with fruits and sweets; while, at a clap
of the hand, black-coated chibouquejees brought in pipes with
amber mouth-pieces of fabulous value, encrusted in diamonds
and rubies. There was a complete Turkish bath establishment
in the Palace, and the slightest wish expressed by the Royal
guests was considered an order.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the arrival the labour of official
functions began, King Edward going to pay a visit to the
Sultan at the Palace of Dolma-Baghtche. The next day the
Royal party saw the Sultan going to the Selamlik, the brilliant
uniforms and the native ladies in their white yashmaks and
brilliantly-coloured dresses producing to Mrs. Grey’s eyes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
effect of a bright flower-garden. While the pageant was passing,
little Prince Izzedin, the Heir-Apparent, visited their
Majesties. Nothing could exceed the anxiety of the Sultan
to entertain his distinguished visitors in a splendid manner,
and he certainly seems to have succeeded.</p>

<p>On 4th April the Royal party dined with the Sultan at the
Palace of Dolma-Baghtche. The dinner was good, and well
served in the European fashion, but it was remarkable for
being the first time that the Sultan had ever sat down to
dinner with ladies; and, indeed, it was the first time that any
of his own Ministers, except the Grand Vizier, had ever been
known to sit down in his presence. Half the party were
Turks, and they looked so frightened and astonished that
they acted as wet blankets to the rest of the company, which
included Mr. Elliot, the British Ambassador, and Mrs. Elliot,
and General Ignatieff, the Russian Ambassador, and his wife.
The Sultan was in high good-humour, but spoke very little.</p>

<p>After dinner Queen Alexandra, attended by Mrs. Grey
and accompanied by Mrs. Elliot and Madame Ignatieff, went
to visit the Sultan’s mother and wife. The visit very much
resembled that which had been paid in Cairo to La Grande
Princesse; and the most amusing part of the evening was
the sudden appearance of the Sultan’s son, aged ten, and
daughter, aged nine, who both came marching in followed
by slaves. Both were enormously over-dressed, the little
girl, indeed, being hardly able to move under all her lace and
finery. They sat themselves down in large arm-chairs, and
the little Princess kept slipping down off hers, but a slave
always helped her up again.</p>

<p>The King and Queen, who adopted for the nonce the name
of Mr. and Mrs. Williams, spent the whole morning of 5th April
in the bazaars, attended by Mrs. Grey, and entirely escaped
being recognised. Another Oriental precedent was broken
on the 7th, when the Royal party went to the opera, and the
Sultan joined the King and Queen and Mrs. Grey in the
Royal box. This was the first time that the Sultan had been
seen with ladies in his box. On the following day Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Alexandra was delighted to have an opportunity of seeing the
Sultan’s stables, containing about 200 horses of extraordinary
beauty.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to describe in detail the ceremonies and
visits to places of interest which the Royal party paid. In this
way the days were filled up until the 10th, when it was decided
that the Queen should accompany the King in his proposed
visit to the Crimea.</p>

<p>After lunching with the Sultan, the Royal party again went
on board the <i>Ariadne</i> with the usual ceremonies, and started
for the Crimea. They had a beautiful passage across the
Black Sea, and arrived in the harbour of Sevastopol on 12th
April. The great struggle with Russia was still fresh in
every one’s memories, and they found not a single ship in the
harbour, and all the forts and fortifications abandoned&mdash;indeed,
the whole town on one side almost one mass of ruins. The
<i>débris</i> remained just as they were left in 1856, and the populace,
which before the war amounted to 60,000, had been reduced to
5500.</p>

<p>As soon as the <i>Ariadne</i> had cast anchor a boat came off
containing General Kotzebue, Governor-General of New
Russia, and General Jukoffsky, Governor of Crim Tartary,
who had come from Simferopol to meet King Edward. They
were accompanied by Admiral Kisalinsky, the Commandant of
Sevastopol, and other officials, together with the British Consul
at Odessa. The Russian authorities offered every possible
assistance to the King and Queen in order that they might see
everything that could be seen.</p>

<p>On that first day of their arrival they visited the Russian
cemetery, and then drove to the battlefield of the Alma, where
Mrs. Grey records the shaking which the Queen and she experienced
in driving over the rough ground still full of great
holes made by the shells used in the battle; indeed, the pony
carriage broke down, and they had to get into a larger one with
four horses. They saw the broken-down bridge over the Alma,
just as it was left after the battle; the party drove through the
water, and Dr. Russell pointed out where the Duke of Cambridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had passed with his Staff&mdash;in fact, the King and Queen
examined the battlefield most thoroughly, studying the various
positions occupied by the forces on both sides.</p>

<p>The Russian authorities entertained the party at luncheon
in a Tartar farm-house, which had been used during the war as
a field-hospital. Dr. Russell, Major Alison, and Captain
Ellis, who had all been there during the war, were perpetually
pointing out fresh places of interest, and in the evening the
Russian officials were entertained at dinner on board the
<i>Ariadne</i>. Nothing could exceed the tact and courtesy of the
Russians, who affected to regard the war as if it had been some
long distant historical campaign, and had no hesitation even in
pointing out to their visitors the different places where the
Russian forces had been beaten.</p>

<p>It is needless to mention the names of all the places visited
by the Royal party. Wherever they went the beautiful old
Russian custom of offering bread and salt was never omitted,
the inhabitants of the villages always rushing out and presenting
these signs of hospitality to Queen Alexandra.</p>

<p>On the 14th the Royal party found the <i>Psyche</i> in the
harbour of Balaklava, in which they embarked and steamed out
of the harbour to see the rocks at the entrance where the ship
<i>Prince</i> was lost in 1845, and where the Duke of Cambridge had
such a narrow escape in the <i>Retribution</i>. On re-landing they
visited the field of Balaklava, and listened to many amusing
stories told by Dr. Russell.</p>

<p>That night the party slept at Livadia, and were most agreeably
entertained by Count Stenboch, who had been sent all the
way from St. Petersburg on purpose to receive the King and
Queen. The <i>Ariadne</i> and <i>Psyche</i> had been sent round from
Sevastopol to meet the party, and after visiting some villas
in the neighbourhood, they all embarked in the <i>Ariadne</i> and
bade farewell to their Russian friends with much regret.</p>

<p>On the 16th they anchored again opposite the Sultan’s
palace, and His Majesty and King Edward exchanged farewell
visits. On the 17th the <i>Ariadne</i> left Constantinople for
Athens; she was lighted up with red and blue lights held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sailors at the end of the yard-arm. The Turkish ships were all
illuminated, and rockets, music, and cheering sped the parting
guests.</p>

<p>Bad weather detained the <i>Ariadne</i> until the 20th, when
they entered the Piræus, where the King of the Hellenes and
Prince Frederick of Glucksburg came on board. The King
had arrived, on purpose to receive the Royal visitors, from
Corfu, where the Court was established, and after two days’
sightseeing His Majesty was to conduct the Royal party there,
where he had left the Queen. King Edward and Queen
Alexandra duly arrived at Corfu on the 24th, and on the following
day, which was the Festival of St. Spiridion&mdash;the patron
saint of Corfu&mdash;they had an opportunity of seeing the town <i>en
fête</i>. The body of the saint was carried in procession amid
much picturesque rejoicing of the populace. On the 27th the
King left for the Albanian coast for some wild boar shooting,
and returned on the following evening, having bagged two
boars and other game.</p>

<p>The visit to Corfu came to an end on 1st May. There was a
great display of fireworks, and the <i>Ariadne</i> and the <i>Royal Oak</i>
were dressed with red and blue lights. Unfortunately there
was a sad accident which occurred just as the illuminations
were over. One of the sailors fell overboard, and though a
most careful search was made, nothing was ever seen or heard
of him again except just the splash as he fell into the water.</p>

<p>On the following day the Royal party arrived at Brindisi,
and returned to London over-land, stopping a little while in
Paris, where they were treated with the most marked attention
by the Emperor and Empress of the French.</p>

<p>As may be easily imagined, the King is very popular all
over France, and he has had many curious and interesting
adventures when going out in the semi-<i>incognito</i> which he
affects when travelling for pleasure. On one occasion, shortly
after the end of the war, he visited the battlefield of Sedan
attended by General Teesdale. He was naturally anxious
that his identity should not become known, for French
susceptibilities were very keen at that time, and he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
desire to appear to glory over his brother-in-law’s brilliant
victories. When the time came to pay the hotel bill
General Teesdale found with great dismay that he had no
ready cash; the King was in an equally penniless condition;
while any telegram sent would have disclosed the identity of
the Royal visitor. At length, after much discussion, the
equerry made his way to the local <i>Mont de Piété</i> and placed
both his own and King Edward’s repeater in pawn.</p>

<p>Among the formal acts of ceremony which King Edward
performed during this year was the unveiling of a statue of the
late Mr. George Peabody. In the speech which he delivered on
this occasion he alluded in the warmest terms to his feeling of
personal friendship towards the United States, and his enduring
recollection of the reception which had been accorded to him
there.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR&mdash;THE KING’S ILLNESS</span></h2>

<p>The outbreak and progress of the Franco-Prussian war were
naturally watched with the keenest interest at Marlborough
House. Two of the King’s own brothers-in-law were serving
with the German forces, while, on the other hand, he not only
had many close ties with France, but from childhood had
always regarded the Emperor and Empress of the French
with special affection. When public subscription lists were
opened in aid of the ambulances, which distributed medical
aid impartially to the sick and wounded on both sides, King
Edward gave a liberal donation; and when the Empress
Eugénie fled to England, one of the first visits which she
received at Chislehurst was from the King and Queen
Alexandra.</p>

<p>Exactly ten years after the first dread news of the Prince
Consort’s fatal illness had gone forth, it became known that
the Heir-Apparent was lying seriously ill at Sandringham.
Not very long before, Princess Alice, who was then staying
at Sandringham, wrote the following note to Queen Victoria:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>“It is the first time since eleven years that I have spent
Bertie’s birthday with him, and though we have only three
of our own family together, still that is better than nothing,
and makes it seem more like a birthday. Bertie and Alix
are so kind, and give us so warm a welcome, showing how
they like having us, that it feels quite home. Indeed, I pray
earnestly that God’s blessing may rest on him, and that he
may be guided to do what is wise and right, so that he may
tide safely through the anxious times that are before him, and
in which we now live.”</p>

<p>Princess Alice little knew the days and nights of anxious
misery that were coming so swiftly upon her brother’s peaceful
household, and indeed upon the whole nation. The King
sickened in London, but as soon as he felt himself to be
seriously attacked he insisted on going home to Norfolk, where
the disease was pronounced to be typhoid fever.</p>

<p>The King, his groom Blegge, and Lord Chesterfield, who
had all been at Scarborough with Lord Londesborough, were
stricken simultaneously, and public attention was soon wholly
concentrated on the three cases. Curiously enough, the groom
and the peer both died, though in neither case were any pains
or expense spared. Doubtless King Edward’s youth and
excellent constitution stood him in good stead, but for many
days the issue was considered exceedingly doubtful.</p>

<p>The patient was nursed entirely by his wife and his sister,
Princess Alice, his medical attendants being Doctors Jenner,
Gull, Clayton, and Lowe. On the last day of November came
an official notification:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Princess of Wales has borne her great trial in the
most admirable manner and with singular equanimity. While
fully aware of the gravity of the Prince’s serious illness, Her
Royal Highness has throughout been calm and collected.”</p>

<p>But the patient’s state was known to be critical, and soon it
was announced that Queen Victoria was going to Sandringham,
which she did on 29th November.</p>

<p>The anxiety, succeeded by the most heart-breaking suspense,
which prevailed in the Royal family is well reflected in
the following extracts from the diary of the late Duchess of
Teck, who was then at Strelitz:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>November 25.</i>&mdash;Read Gussy Alix’s letter to Mama about
our poor, dear Wales, who was attacked with the fever about
the 19th or so, and is under Dr. Gull’s charge, who says it
must have its twenty-four days’ course, and that so far all is
going on as well as can be expected.</p>

<p>“<i>December 1.</i>&mdash;… When I finished my packet for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
messenger, I telegraphed to darling Alix, and flew up to Mama
to consult her about it.… From Alix somewhat better
news reached us, after a bad telegram at three from dear Alice.</p>

<p>“<i>December 2.</i>&mdash;A rather better account of Wales.</p>

<p>“<i>December 3.</i>&mdash;Wales improving.…</p>

<p>“<i>December 5.</i>&mdash;… Better accounts from Sandringham,
but poor Lord Chesterfield dead.</p>

<p>“<i>December 6.</i>&mdash;… Reassuring message from Alice.</p>

<p>“<i>December 8.</i>&mdash;… Opened a telegram with anxious and
distressing news from Sandringham; poor dear Wales has had
a relapse; his state evidently very critical. <i>Gott helfe weiter.</i>
We were much upset, and with a heavy heart I closed my
packet for the messenger and wrote till dressing-time, though
I had much difficulty in settling down to anything.… Mama
was very silent all dinner-time, but we never for a moment
suspected, what we afterwards learnt had been the case, that
she had received a worse telegram at five o’clock, and had in
kindness kept it from us.… I wrote <i>chez moi</i> till a most
alarming telegram from Alice to Mama was brought me, with
which I hastened to Gussy.… We cried over the almost
hopeless accounts together, which spoke of the end as not far
distant, provided dear Wales did not at once rally, and with
despairing hearts we joined the others in the blue drawing-room.
Fritz came in presently, and I read him the three telegrams
received that day, and a letter from Lady Macclesfield. Later
Mama sent for Gussy and me to wish us a sorrowful good
night. I then went to my room and wrote till nearly four,
feeling sleep out of the question.</p>

<p>“<i>December 9.</i>&mdash;Gussy rushed in with a rather more hopeful
telegram: ‘Night quiet, exhaustion not increased, breathing
clearer.’ God grant he may yet rally and pull through! It
was a relief after all we had undergone, and thank God for it;
the agony of suspense was hard to bear.…</p>

<p>“<i>December 10.</i>&mdash;On our return from church we found a
telegram from Sandringham, which Gussy tremblingly opened.
<i>Es lautete, ‘a shade better.’</i> Thank God! I ran with it to
Tante<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>.…</p>

<p>“<i>December 11.</i>&mdash;About noon Geraldo rushed in with two
telegrams, one sent off last night, the other this morning;
both <i>heartrendingly sad</i>, and giving next to no hope, but for
the words, ‘Yet we hope.’ They were a <i>cruel</i> check to our
faint hopes. We could think and talk of nothing else.…</p>

<p>“<i>December 12.</i>&mdash;Dolphus brought us a very hopeless telegram
from Alice: ‘Night restless, very delirious, no signs of
improvement.’ After a while I went to my room and read the
papers with accounts from Sandringham and Windsor.…</p>

<p>“<i>December 13.</i>&mdash;… To Mama’s <i>entrée</i>, where I found
her, Gussy, and Tante much upset over a very disquieting
message from Alice, which said, ‘Night without rest. No
important change in the general state. Breathing is weak.
Anxiety increased.’ One can only look to God’s great mercy
for further hope!</p>

<p>“<i>December 14.</i>&mdash;… Bülow congratulated me on the
better accounts which had just been received from Sandringham!
It was the first I had heard of it; just at that moment
Wenckstern appeared with the telegram: ‘Quiet sleep at
intervals, gravity of symptoms diminished, state more hopeful.&mdash;Alice.’
God be thanked for this blessed change!… I
read aloud in Mama’s room, amid tears and sobs, the touching
account in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of our dear Wales’s illness, of
all that goes on at Sandringham, of the prayers for him and the
sermons preached about him.</p>

<p>“<i>December 15.</i>&mdash;A much more hopeful telegram from Alice,
as follows: ‘Bertie has passed a quiet night. The debility is
great, but the conditions are much more favourable.’ Thank
God for this great mercy.”</p>

<p>The feeling aroused through the United Kingdom was
far greater than any public expression of emotion since the
death of Princess Charlotte in 1817. In every town, crowds
waited anxiously for the issue of newspapers containing the
latest news of the Royal patient’s condition, and the Government
found it expedient to forward the medical bulletins to
every telegraph office in the United Kingdom. In the
churches of every religious communion, prayers were offered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
though almost without hope, for the recovery of King
Edward.</p>

<p>At length, on 1st December, the King recovered consciousness,
and his first remark to those about him was, “This is the
Princess’s birthday.” The next coherent utterance came when
he heard that Queen Victoria had been at Sandringham. “Has
the Queen come from Scotland? Does she know I am ill?”
he asked; but this slight rally did not continue, and soon all
the Royal family were summoned to Sandringham. On 9th
December the fever had spent itself, but the patient’s strength
was considered to be exhausted. Special prayers were offered
up in all churches; and shortly before the service in St. Mary
Magdalene’s, Sandringham, the Vicar received the following
note from Queen Alexandra:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My husband being, thank God, somewhat better, I am
coming to church. I must leave, I fear, before the service is
concluded, that I may watch by his bedside. Can you not say
a few words in prayer in the early part of the service, that I
may join with you in prayer for my husband before I return to
him?”</p>

<p>The Vicar, before reading the Collect, in a voice trembling
with emotion, which he vainly strove to suppress, said: “The
prayers of the congregation are earnestly sought for His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales, who is now most seriously ill.”</p>

<p>The day following, an article in the <i>Times</i> began: “The
Prince still lives, and we may still therefore hope”; and so the
weary days dragged on. On the 16th it was recorded that the
patient had enjoyed a quiet and refreshing sleep, and on the
17th, a Sunday, those of the Royal family who were then at
Sandringham were present at church, when, by special request,
the Prince and Blegge were recommended to the mercy of God
in the same prayer. That same day Queen Alexandra visited
the poor dying groom, and after his death, which occurred
within the next few hours, both she and Queen Victoria found
time, in the midst of their terrible anxiety, to visit and comfort
his relations.</p>

<p>By Christmas Day the danger may be said to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
over, and on 26th December Queen Victoria wrote the following
letter to the nation:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Queen is very anxious to express her deep sense of
the touching sympathy of the whole nation on the occasion of
the alarming illness of her dear son, the Prince of Wales. The
universal feeling shown by her people during those painful,
terrible days, and the sympathy evinced by them with herself
and her beloved daughter, the Princess of Wales, as well as
the general joy at the improvement of the Prince of Wales’s
state, have made a deep and lasting impression on her heart,
which can never be effaced.…”</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra and Princess Alice now felt that their
patient was well enough for them to leave him for an hour or
two in order to assist at the distribution of Christmas gifts to
the labourers on the estate. In the ceiling of the room afterwards
occupied by Queen Alexandra as a bed-chamber, the
mark of an orifice might be seen from which projected a hook
supporting a trapeze, by the aid of which the patient, when on
the slow and weary road to convalescence, could change his
position and pull himself up into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>Another memento of the King’s terrible illness is the brass
lectern in the parish church. On it runs an inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To the glory of God.<br />
A thank-offering for His mercy.<br />
14th December 1871.<br />
Alexandra.</span></p>

<p class="center">“When I was in trouble I called upon the Lord, and He heard me.”</p>

</div>

<p>The last bulletin was issued on 14th January, and nine days
later Sir William Jenner was gazetted a K.C.B. and Dr. W.
Gull was created a Baronet&mdash;rewards which gave particular
satisfaction to the nation.</p>

<p>It was whispered at the time that King Edward, under
Providence, really owed his recovery to one of those sudden
inspirations of genius of which the history of medicine is full.
He seemed to be actually <i>in extremis</i>, when one of his medical
attendants sent in haste for two bottles of old champagne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
brandy and rubbed the patient with it vigorously all over till
returning animation rewarded the doctor’s efforts.</p>

<p>King Edward’s recovery was hailed with feelings of deep
thankfulness by the whole nation, and it was universally deemed
appropriate that public thanks should be returned to Almighty
God for His great mercy. The utmost interest was taken by
all classes of society in the preparations for the proposed
National Thanksgiving. Mr. William Longman wrote to the
<i>Times</i> urging that, as in 1664 and 1678, subscriptions should
be invited for the completion of the Cathedral Church of St.
Paul in London as a perpetual memorial of the event.</p>

<p>During the interval before the day fixed for the National
Thanksgiving, King Edward and Queen Alexandra paid visits
to Windsor and Osborne. When they returned to London
one of the first visitors they received was Dr. Stanley, who
had now become Dean of Westminster. It was resolved that
they should attend a private service of thanksgiving in the
Abbey, which the Dean thus describes in a letter to an intimate
correspondent:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I went to Marlborough House to suggest, through Fisher
and Keppel, that the Prince of Wales should come. He consented
at once, and it was agreed that he, the Princess, and
the Crown Prince of Denmark, and if in town, Prince Alfred,
should come. I kept it a secret except from the Canons. We
met them at the great Western door; the nave (as usual) was
quite clear. They walked in with me, and took their places on
my right. I preached on Psalm cxxii. 1. The Prince of Wales
heard every word, and has decided that it shall be published,
which it will be, and you shall have a copy. It was one of
those rare occasions on which I was able to say all that I
wished to say. They were conducted again to the West door,
and departed.”</p>

<p>The day fixed for the public National Thanksgiving in St.
Paul’s was 27th February, and never, save perhaps on 22nd June
1897, did Queen Victoria and her eldest son and daughter-in-law
receive a more splendid and heartfelt welcome. Thirteen
thousand people were admitted to the Cathedral, among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
being most of the notable personages of the day, including all
the great officers of State.</p>

<p>The procession set out from Buckingham Palace at twelve
o’clock. First came the Speaker, the Lord Chancellor, and the
Commander-in-Chief, in their carriages, followed by nine Royal
equipages, in the last of which sat Queen Victoria, dressed in
black velvet trimmed with broad bands of white ermine, Queen
Alexandra in blue silk covered with black lace, King Edward
in the uniform of a British general and wearing the Collars of
the Orders of the Garter and the Bath, Prince Albert Victor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
then a boy of eight, and Princess Beatrice. The late Duchess
of Teck, to her great grief, could not be present, as her eldest
son had sickened with scarlet fever.</p>

<p>In the Green Park the procession was greeted by an army
of 30,000 children, who sang the National Anthem as the Royal
carriages drove by.</p>

<p>St. Paul’s was reached at one o’clock, and the Royal party
were received at the great West door by the Dean and Chapter.
Queen Victoria passed up the nave leaning on the arm of her
son, who conducted Her Majesty to a pew which had been
specially prepared for the occasion.</p>

<p>The service began with the “Te Deum,” and after some
prayers a special form of thanksgiving which had been officially
drawn up was said. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury
preached a short sermon from the text, Romans xii. 5,
“Members one of another.” The service concluded with a
thanksgiving hymn which had been specially written for the
occasion. The proceedings were over by two o’clock, and the
procession returned by a different route, along Holborn and
Oxford Street, in the presence of an enthusiastic crowd said
to be the largest ever collected in London. As the poet
sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Two days later Queen Victoria wrote from Buckingham
Palace to Mr. Gladstone, who was then Prime Minister, one
of those touching letters which on many occasions drew still
more closely together the ties of loyalty and affection between
Her Majesty and her people. The Queen wrote that she was
anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> “to express publicly her own personal very deep sense
of the reception she and her dear children met with on Tuesday,
the 27th of February, from millions of her subjects on her way
to and from St. Paul’s. Words are too weak for the Queen
to say how very deeply touched and gratified she has been
by the immense enthusiasm and affection exhibited towards
her dear son and herself, from the highest down to the lowest,
in the long progress through the capital, and she would
earnestly wish to convey her warmest and most heartfelt
thanks to the whole nation for this great demonstration of
loyalty. The Queen, as well as her son and dear daughter-in-law,
felt that the whole nation joined with them in thanking
God for sparing the beloved Prince of Wales’s life.…”</p>

<p>Although the Duchess of Teck had not been able to attend
the Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul’s, she returned to England
in time to take part in a great ceremony which took place on
the 1st of May at the Crystal Palace. Referring to this occasion,
she writes:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>“We drove down to Sydenham with Louise as
Alfred’s guests to attend the <i>fête</i> in celebration of Wales’s
recovery. Concert: Sullivan’s <i>Te Deum</i>, Miscellanies with
Titiens.”</p>

<p>The impression made by King Edward’s illness and
marvellous recovery upon the Royal family in general is
well illustrated by the following passage from a letter written
by Princess Alice to her mother in December 1872:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>“That our good, sweet Alix should have been spared this
terrible grief, when this time last year it seemed so imminent,
fills my heart with gratitude for her dear sake, as for yours,
his children and ours.… The 14th will now be a day of
mixed recollections and feelings to us, a day hallowed in our
family, when one great spirit ended his work on earth …
and when another was left to fulfil his duty and mission, God
grant, for the welfare of his own family and of thousands.”</p>

<p>The year 1873 was spent on the whole very quietly by the
King and Queen. His Majesty took up once more the thread
of his public life which had been interrupted for a considerable
time by his illness and convalescence.</p>

<p>A pleasant glimpse of the home life at Sandringham about
this time is given in the following letters from the witty and
eloquent Archbishop Magee (then Bishop of Peterborough),
written to his wife:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sandringham</span>, <i>6th December 1873</i>.</p>

<p>“… I arrived just as they were all at tea in the entrance
hall, and had to walk in, all seedy and dishevelled from my
day’s journey, and sit down beside the Princess of Wales,
with Disraeli on the other side of me, and sundry lords and
ladies round the table. The Prince received me very kindly,
and certainly has most winning and gracious manners. The
Princess seems smaller and thinner than I remember her at
Dublin. They seem to be pleasant and domesticated, with
little state and very simple ways.”</p>

<p class="right">“<i>7th December 1873.</i></p>

<p>“Just returned from church, where I preached for twenty-six
minutes (Romans viii. 28). The church is a very small
country one close to the grounds. The house, as I saw it by
daylight, is a handsome country house of red stone with white
facings, standing well and looking quietly comfortable and
suitable. I find the company pleasant and civil, but we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a curious mixture. Two Jews, Sir A. Rothschild and his
daughter; an ex-Jew, Disraeli; a Roman Catholic, Colonel
Higgins; an Italian duchess who is an Englishwoman, and
her daughter brought up as a Roman Catholic and now turning
Protestant; a set of young lords, and a bishop. The
Jewess came to church; so did the half-Protestant young lady.
Dizzy did the same, and was profuse in his praises of my
sermon. We are all to lunch together in a few minutes, the
children dining with us. They seem, the two I saw in church,
nice, clever-looking little bodies, and very like their mother.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>King Edward and Queen Alexandra represented Queen
Victoria at the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh and the
Grand Duchess Marie of Russia in January 1874. The
English marriage service was performed by Dean Stanley,
who wrote to Queen Victoria an interesting letter describing
the Imperial wedding, in which he mentioned how much he
had been struck, both in the chapel and at the subsequent
banquet, by the singular difference in character and expression
of the four future kings, the Prince of Wales, the Crown
Prince of Prussia, the Cesarewitch, and the Crown Prince of
Denmark, who were all present.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following the wedding King Edward and
Queen Alexandra attended the service at the English Church
in St. Petersburg, and the Dean preached on the marriage
feast at Cana in Galilee, much the same sermon which he had
preached in the Chapel-Royal at Whitehall on the Sunday following
the marriage of their Majesties. All through this visit to
Russia their Majesties were received with unusual distinction, and
a grand parade of troops was held in honour of King Edward.</p>

<p>King Edward dined in the Middle Temple Hall on Grand
Night of Trinity term in 1874. On this occasion His Majesty
humorously expressed the opinion that it was a good thing for
the profession at large, and for the public in general, that he
had never practised at the Bar, for he could never have been
an ornament to it. In saying this his modesty probably led him
astray, for he is a thoughtful and lucid speaker, and his habits of
method and order would certainly have stood him in good stead if
he had been compelled to apply his mind to any profession. His
Majesty was elected a Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1861,
and served the office of Treasurer in the Jubilee year of 1887.</p>

<p>When King Edward and Queen Alexandra were first
married they always gave two great balls at Marlborough
House each year&mdash;one on the anniversary of their wedding
day, and one at the close of the London season. But the
most splendid entertainment ever given by their Majesties
was the great fancy dress ball in July 1874. Over fourteen
hundred invitations were sent out, and the Royal host and
hostess made no stipulations as to the choice of costume,
leaving it to individual taste. The Queen wore a Venetian
dress, and was attended by her two young sons as pages.
The King appeared as Charles I., wearing a costume exactly
copied from the famous Vandyke picture, that is, a maroon
satin and velvet suit, partly covered with a short black velvet
cloak, while the black hat, trimmed with one long white
feather, was looped up with an aigrette of brilliants. He also
wore high buff boots, long spurs and sword, while round his
neck hung the Collar of the Garter.</p>

<p>Many of the costumes worn were very interesting and
curious. In the Fairy Tale Quadrille, the Earl of Rosebery,
then quite a youth, was Blue Beard; Mr. Albert (now Earl)
Grey, Puss in Boots; and the Duke of Connaught, the Beast.
Lord Charles and Lord Marcus Beresford were a couple of
Court jesters. The only person present who was not in fancy
dress was Benjamin Disraeli, then Prime Minister. He wore
the official dress of a Privy Councillor.</p>

<p>That same year the King and Queen visited Birmingham
for the first time, being received by the then mayor, Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain, who was at the time credited with being
so advanced a Republican that many fears were expressed that
he might behave with scant courtesy to his Royal guests, and
bets were even taken as to whether he would consent to
shake hands with them! However, these prognostications
proved groundless, and it is particularly interesting to recall the
comment which the <i>Times</i> made on the following day:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>“Whatever Mr. Chamberlain’s views may be, his speeches
of yesterday appear to us to have been admirably worthy of
the occasion, and to have done the highest credit to himself.
We have heard and chronicled a great many mayors’ speeches,
but we do not know that we ever heard or chronicled speeches
made before Royal personages by mayors, whether they were
Tories or Whigs, or Liberals or Radicals, which were couched
in such a tone at once of courteous homage, manly independence,
and gentlemanly feeling, which were so perfectly becoming
and so much the right thing in every way as those of Mr.
Chamberlain.”</p>

<p>On the same day that this appeared in the leading journal,
Sir Francis Knollys wrote to Mr. Chamberlain a most cordial
letter, in which he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have received the commands of the Prince and Princess
of Wales to make known through you to the inhabitants of the
borough of Birmingham the satisfaction they derived from their
visit to that town yesterday. They can never forget the reception
they met with, nor the welcome given to them by all classes
of the community.… I may further congratulate you and the
other members of the reception committee on the happy result
of their labours. Nothing could have been more successful, and
their Royal Highnesses will ever entertain most agreeable
recollections of their visit to Birmingham.”</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Chamberlain was informed that the King
wished to give £100 to a Birmingham charity, and was asked
to state which he considered to be the most deserving, and at
the same time the most in need of support.</p>

<p>The festivities of the following Christmas were overshadowed
by the death at Sandringham from inflammation of
the lungs of Colonel Grey, who had been for some time a
valued member of the Household. It was with reference to
this sad loss that Princess Alice wrote to Queen Victoria:&mdash;“Dear
Bertie’s true and constant heart suffers on such
occasions, for he can be constant in friendship, and all who
serve him, serve him with warm attachment.”</p>

<p>In 1875 the death of Canon Kingsley came as a great blow
to their Majesties, who were both fondly attached to the
famous writer.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE KING’S TOUR IN INDIA</span></h2>

<p>Lord Canning, the great Viceroy of India, once told the
Prince Consort how desirable he thought it that the Prince
of Wales should, when grown up, visit Queen Victoria’s
Eastern Empire, and later on, those who had the privilege
of the young Prince’s friendship were well aware that an
Indian tour had become one of his most ardent wishes.</p>

<p>But the project of the Heir-Apparent’s visit to India only
really took shape early in 1875, and on 20th March it was
publicly announced that the Prince contemplated this journey,
the Marquis of Salisbury, who was then Secretary of State for
India, making an official announcement to the Council of India
of the intended event. The Council passed a resolution that
the expenditure actually incurred in India should be charged
on the revenues of that country.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, a great deal of hostile feeling was aroused
by the announcement of this Royal tour. On 17th July a great
meeting was held in Hyde Park to protest against the grant
of money which was then being sanctioned by Parliament to
defray the expenses of the journey. Many people went so far
as to declare that they would have acquiesced in the passing
of the vote had the Heir-Apparent’s visit to his mother’s
Eastern dominions been a “State visit” instead of a mere
“pleasure trip.” And yet it need hardly be pointed out that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
greatly as King Edward looked forward to his tour, the
journey was likely to prove anything but a mere “pleasure
trip” to India’s Royal visitor. He and those about him well
knew that from the moment he landed at Bombay till the day
he left India he would not only constantly remain <i>en évidence</i>,
but he also expected to conciliate the many different races with
which he was going to be brought in contact when passing
through the various Indian States.</p>

<p>There were many points to be considered about the tour.
The rules and regulations which had sufficed for the Prince in
Canada and the Colonies were inapplicable to India. One
notable feature of Oriental manners is the exchange of presents
between visitors and hosts, and it was early arranged that
King Edward’s luggage should contain £40,000 worth of
presents to be distributed among the great feudatory and
other potentates who would have the honour of entertaining
or at any rate of meeting him.</p>

<p>It was also arranged that he was to be the guest of the
Viceroy, Lord Northbrook, from the moment he landed on
Indian soil; and, roughly speaking, it was estimated that the
expenses of the reception alone would probably come to
about £30,000. The estimate made by the Admiralty for the
expenses of the voyage to and from India, and the movements
of the fleet in connection with the Royal visit, came
to £52,000; while for the personal expenses of the visit a
vote of £60,000 was included in the estimate submitted to
the House of Commons when in Committee of Supply. However,
here again this suggestion did not meet with universal
approval when the necessary resolution was brought forward
in the House. Mr. Fawcett, afterwards Postmaster-General,
raised a discussion, basing his objections to the vote partly
on sentimental and partly on economic grounds. However,
he only found thirty-three members to agree with him, and
the vote was passed. During the debate, Mr. Disraeli, who
was then Prime Minister, drew a very remarkable picture of
the extraordinary pomp and circumstance with which King
Edward was about to be surrounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>It was felt better that he should go as Heir-Apparent of
the Crown, and not as the representative of Her Majesty, but,
as might have been expected, these fine distinctions were not
understood in India, and he was expected to do just as much
as he would have done in a more directly official capacity.</p>

<p>Before starting on his tour he thoroughly studied the
subject of India and her peoples, and he even made himself
acquainted with the peculiarities of every one of the large
Indian cities where he would be expected to receive and answer
addresses.</p>

<p>The question of the suite was, as may be imagined, very
important. It was early decided that Sir Bartle Frere, whose
name was familiar to millions of the inhabitants of India, should
accompany King Edward, and the Duke of Sutherland was also
asked to join the party. Of his private friends, the Earl of Aylesford,
Lord (now Earl) Carrington, Colonel (now General) Owen
Williams, and Lieutenant (now Admiral) Lord Charles Beresford,
also accepted an invitation to be of the party. Then
came the official Household, consisting of Lord Suffield;
Colonel Ellis, the Prince’s equerry, to whom was confided
the delicate question of the giving and receiving of presents;
General (now Sir Dighton) Probyn, to whom were left the
arrangements for horses, travelling, and shooting parties; and
Mr. (now Sir Francis) Knollys, the Prince’s private secretary.
Canon Duckworth went as chaplain, and Dr. (now Sir Joseph)
Fayrer as medical man. Mr. Albert Grey (now Earl Grey)
went as private secretary to Sir Bartle Frere, Mr. S. P. Hall
accompanied the party in order to sketch the incidents of the
tour, while Lord Alfred Paget was specially commissioned
by Queen Victoria to join the suite. Dr. W. H. (now Sir
William) Russell, the famous war correspondent, who was
temporarily attached to the suite as honorary private secretary,
wrote on his return a very interesting account of the tour,
entitled “The Prince of Wales’s Tour in India,” which has
remained the standard authority on the subject.</p>

<p>On the day that King Edward left Sandringham, amid
many demonstrations of goodwill and wishings of God-speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
from his country neighbours, he presented his Consort with a
team of Corsican ponies and a miniature drag. He spent the
last few days of his stay in England with Queen Alexandra and
their children at Marlborough House. On the Sunday before
his departure they were all present at divine service in
Westminster Abbey, and the next day the King went to say
good-bye to his old friend Dean Stanley, who, in a letter to
an intimate correspondent, gave the following vivid description
of the visit:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the Sunday night we had a message to say that the
Prince and Princess of Wales would come to take leave of us at
3.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> the next day. They came about 4 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, having been
detained by the members of the family coming to Marlborough
House.</p>

<p>“They brought all the five children, wishing, the Prince
said, to have them all with him as long as possible.</p>

<p>“They all came up, and remained about twenty minutes.
Fanny was in the back library, and the children, after being for
a few minutes with Augusta, who was delighted to see them,
went to her.</p>

<p>“The Prince and Princess remained with Augusta and me.
A. talked with all her usual animation. They were both extremely
kind. The Princess looked inexpressibly sad. There
was nothing much said of interest, chiefly talking of the
voyage, etc. As I took him downstairs, he spoke of the
dangers&mdash;but calmly and rationally, saying that, of course
the precautions must be left to those about him. I said to
him, ‘I gave you my parting benediction in the Abbey yesterday.’
‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘I saw it. Thank you.’</p>

<p>“Later on in the evening Augusta wished me to telegraph
our renewed thanks and renewed good wishes to the <i>Castalia</i>
at Dover. I did so, and at 11 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> there came back a telegram
from him: ‘Many thanks for your kind message. God bless
both of you! Just off for Calais!’”</p>

<p>King Edward started from London on 11th October, immense
popular interest being taken in the event. Huge
crowds assembled long before the departure of the special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
train from Charing Cross, and the King and Queen Alexandra
were wildly cheered. The Queen accompanied her husband
as far as Calais, and then the King travelled across the
Continent <i>incognito</i>, meeting his suite, who had started a few
days previously, at Brindisi.</p>

<div id="illus48" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Embarkation on Board the “Serapis” at Brindisi</span></p>

</div>

<p>The eventful journey was made in the <i>Serapis</i>, one of the
old large Indian troopships, and the voyage was very successful
from every point of view. The Royal party spent a few
days at Athens, where the King was entertained by his
brother-in-law, the King of Greece, to whom he had brought
a number of gifts from Sandringham, including an Alderney
bull and cow, a ram and sheep, several British pigs, and a
number of horses.</p>

<p>From the Piræus the <i>Serapis</i> proceeded to Egypt, and King
Edward invested Prince Tewfik, the Khedive’s eldest son, with
the Order of the Star of India.</p>

<p>As the <i>Serapis</i> steamed onwards the various programmes
of the Royal progress through India were submitted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
King, and even the addresses which were to be presented to
him were shown and his answers were carefully prepared; in
fact, before he left Aden, His Majesty knew with what words
the Corporation of Bombay, for instance, would receive him.</p>

<p>As may be easily imagined, all India was by now in a
ferment of excitement, and the official world were very much
concerned at the immense responsibility placed upon them by
the mother-country. Four officers, of whom two had obtained
the Victoria Cross, were carefully selected and commissioned
to look after the comfort and the safety of the King and of his
suite, Major Bradford (afterwards Sir E. R. C. Bradford, Chief
Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police) being entrusted with
the responsible task of attending to the safety of the Royal
visitor’s own person.</p>

<p>The question as to how King Edward was to make his first
appearance in Bombay was keenly discussed, and at one time
it was thought that splendidly caparisoned elephants would
form the most fitting mode of transport from the landing-stage
to Government House, but finally the party went in carriages.
Among the cargo of the <i>Serapis</i> were three valuable horses,
specially chosen from the Marlborough House stables, which
had been regularly taken to the Zoo, in order to be accustomed
to the sight of the wild beasts and reptiles which they were
likely to meet with in India.</p>

<p>At last it was noised abroad that the <i>Serapis</i> had been
sighted, and the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook (afterwards Earl of
Northbrook), went out to meet King Edward, returning to
Bombay in order to receive him on landing. There was a good
deal of discreet curiosity as to which of them would give precedence
to the other, for of course the Viceroy represents Her
Majesty, and so was entitled to take precedence, but Lord
Northbrook, with considerable tact, unobtrusively gave his
Royal guest the first place.</p>

<p>The moment the King emerged from the dockyard a salute
was fired, and at every station in India, whether important or
obscure, the signal was given by telegraph for a Royal salute
wherever there were guns to fire it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>While actually in Bombay King Edward and his suite
became the guests of the Governor, Sir Philip Woodhouse, and
it was there that two days after his arrival in India the King
celebrated his thirty-fourth birthday, the first object which met
his eyes in the morning being a charming portrait of Queen
Alexandra, who had specially entrusted it to Sir Bartle Frere.
On this eventful day the glories and the fatigues of the King’s
Indian tour may be said to have begun.</p>

<p>The Royal birthday was duly honoured all over Hindustan
at noon, and although the heat, even at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, had been very
considerable, the King was compelled to hold a great reception
in full dress, that is to say, in a uniform of English cloth loaded
with lace and buttoned up to the throat. The scene was very
impressive. The King during the reception was seated on a
silver throne, and everything was done to invest the affair with
the greatest pomp and circumstance. His suite all stood round
him in full uniform; behind the throne was a portrait of Queen
Victoria; and although the King was not supposed to hold
durbars, the ceremony being simply styled a private visit or
reception, it was in every way as impressive and remarkable
as if it had carried full official significance.</p>

<p>An immense number of native Princes and Rajahs paid
their respects in person to their future Sovereign. The first
potentate to be presented was the Rajah of Kholapur, a child
of twelve years old, the ruler of nearly a million people. The
little Rajah was attired in purple velvet and white muslin
encrusted with gems, his turban containing a King’s ransom
of pearls and rubies. In spite of his extreme youth the Indian
Prince remained perfectly serious, and went through the
somewhat complicated ceremonies with absolute self-possession.</p>

<p>After the last Rajah had departed, King Edward had a
long talk with the Viceroy, and then made his way to the
<i>Serapis</i>, where he had the pleasure of seeing the crew enjoying
the birthday dinner provided by himself. He also cut a
birthday cake, and looked over the telegrams just received
from Sandringham. That same evening was held a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
reception, to which naturally the British officials and residents
came in great force.</p>

<p>The next few days were also equally well filled. King
Edward had to pay elaborate return visits to the chiefs and
Rajahs who had attended his reception, and it was then that
he was enabled to show his tact and the extraordinary
knowledge he had acquired of their complicated ranks and
genealogies; indeed, he greatly pleased several important
Rajahs by showing that he had heard of the antiquity of
their families, and by graciously alluding to the gallant deeds
of their ancestors. The British people of Bombay had
organised a great dinner for the sailors of the fleet, and,
much to their gratification, the King consented to attend the
banquet. Not content with a mere formal glance at the
proceedings, he mounted a plank, and with a glass in his
hand, exclaimed to the delighted men, of whom there were
over two thousand present, “My lads, I am glad to meet
you all. I drink your good health, and a happy voyage
home.”</p>

<p>King Edward took the opportunity of laying the foundation-stone
of the Elphinstone Docks, the ceremony being carried
out with Masonic honours, and it was considered very
interesting and significant that among members of the craft
present were Parsees, Mahomedans, and Hindus.</p>

<p>During the month of November the King visited Poona,
where he held a review, and visited the Court of the Gaikwar
of Baroda. There a fine elephant was prepared for his use.
The animal was of extraordinary size, and the howdah on
which the King rode was said to have cost four lakhs of
rupees. He held a reception at the Residency, and had his
first sight of Indian sport, for he attended a cheetah hunt,
himself killing a fine buck, and much enjoying his day’s sport.
About the same time he also joined a pig-sticking expedition,
a very popular Indian sport, and at last, to his great satisfaction,
had the opportunity of “getting his spear,” in other words,
of killing a wild boar.</p>

<p>Then, returning to Bombay, the Royal party once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
took up their quarters on the <i>Serapis</i>, where the King spent
Queen Alexandra’s birthday. From Bombay he found time
to visit the Portuguese settlement of Goa, and thence went
on to Ceylon, where he inspected a tea plantation, and where
the peepul planted by him in commemoration of his visit is
still proudly shown to the ubiquitous globe-trotter.</p>

<p>At Madras the King had a splendid reception, spending,
however, 14th December, the anniversary of his father’s death,
in retirement at Guindy Park, the country seat of the Governor,
eight miles from the city.</p>

<p>Christmas Day was spent in Calcutta, where an immense
programme was gone through, including a considerable number
of public ceremonies, the holding of audiences, and last, but
not least, a <i>levée</i>, at which both natives and Europeans were
present. After the King and the Viceroy had attended divine
service in the Cathedral, His Majesty entertained a large party
at lunch in the <i>Serapis</i>. His health was drunk with Highland
honours, and many messages were exchanged between himself
and “home.” On the afternoon of the same day the Royal
party drove out to the Viceregal Lodge at Barrackpur.</p>

<p>The most important ceremony attended by King Edward
in India, namely, a Chapter of the Order of the Star of India,
at which he acted as High Commissioner for his Royal mother,
was held on New Year’s Day 1876. His Majesty wore a
field-marshal’s uniform, almost concealed beneath the folds of
his sky-blue satin mantle, the train of which was carried by two
naval cadets, who wore cocked hats over their powdered wigs,
blue satin cloaks, trunk hose, and shoes with rosettes. The
Chapter tent was carpeted with cloth of gold with the Royal
Arms emblazoned in the centre. An immense number of the
Companions of the Order attended, forming a most impressive
procession, walking two and two, one half native and the other
European. The Begum of Bhopal, the first Knight Grand
Commander, had a procession all to herself. She was veiled
and swathed in brocades and silks, over which was folded the
light blue satin robe of the Order.</p>

<p>The King took his seat on the daïs, and after the roll of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Order had been read, each member standing up as his
name was called, the Chapter was declared open, and His
Majesty directed the investiture to proceed. Never had such
a gathering been seen in India. Among those present were
Lord Napier of Magdala, “Political” Maitland, the Maharajah
of Kashmir, and the Rajah of Patiala, who wore the great
Sancy diamond in his turban.</p>

<p>As each investiture took place, seventeen guns were fired,
and the secretary proclaimed aloud the titles of the newly-made
Knight Grand Commander or Companion as the case might
be. The pageant was incomparably splendid, the close of the
ceremony being quite as fine as the beginning, for the Knights
Grand Cross, the Knights Grand Commanders, and the Companions
all formed once more in a procession in the reverse
order of their entry.</p>

<p>At the close of the King’s visit to Calcutta he began his
journeys by rail. At Benares he visited the famous Temples,
and the Golden Pool, going from thence by steamer to the
old port of Rammagar, where he and his suite were splendidly
received by the Maharajah, who presented him with some very
costly shawls and brocades, together with what is to an Indian
the very highest proof of regard, namely his own walking-stick,
a thick staff mounted with gold.</p>

<p>At Lucknow the King laid the foundation-stone of a
memorial to the natives who fell in the defence of the
Residency. On this occasion he took the opportunity of
paying a well-deserved tribute to the faithful soldiers of the
native army. Some of the veterans were presented to him,
and they were not allowed to be hurried by, ragged, squalid,
or unclean; indeed, His Majesty insisted on exchanging a few
words with several of them.</p>

<p>While at Lucknow he took part in a pig-sticking expedition,
at which Lord Carrington’s left collar-bone was broken, and
curiously enough, Lord Napier of Magdala met with a precisely
similar accident on the same day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King’s Visit to the Cawnpore Memorial</span></p>

</div>

<p>From Delhi the King proceeded to Cawnpore, a spot he
had been extremely anxious to visit, in common with many
less illustrious tourists. His Majesty, after a drive to the
site of the old cantonments, where the heroic defence took
place, made his way to the Memorial Church, where he
stopped close to the gateway which no native may pass
through. There he alighted, and, with signs of deep emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
walked to the spot which marks the place of the fatal well.
There was deep silence as he read aloud in a low voice the
touching words, “To the memory of a great company of
Christian people, principally women and children, who were
cruelly slaughtered here.”</p>

<p>On returning to Delhi the King held a <i>levée</i>, attended by
hundreds of British officers, at the close of which several
notabilities of the native army were presented. The next
day a great review was held, Lord Napier of Magdala entertaining
His Majesty at his own camp. Delhi was illuminated,
and no trouble was spared in showing what was once the
capital city of India to the Royal visitor.</p>

<p>Some interesting hours were spent at Agra, where the
King went to see the Taj illuminated, the beautiful marble
“Queen of Sorrow” erected by the Shah Jehan in memory
of his much-loved wife, Moomtaz i Mahul, who died at the
birth of her eighth child. The King was so greatly charmed
with the beauty of the Taj, lit up by myriad lights, that he
would not return to the city till nearly midnight. All through
the journeys and expeditions which immediately followed, His
Majesty could not forget what he had seen, and before finally
leaving the district he paid one more visit to the famous tomb,
seeing it this time not illuminated, but by the beautiful full
Indian moonlight.</p>

<p>The King shot his first tiger on 5th February in the
neighbourhood of Jeypur, but it was by no means the last, for it
is recorded that he shot six tigers in one day when hunting in
Nepaul with Sir Jung Bahadur. Then he returned through Lucknow,
Cawnpore, and Allahabad. At Jubbulpur His Majesty
went through the prison, and had some talk with seven Thugs
who had been thirty-five years in confinement, and whose life
in the first instance had only been spared because they had
turned Queen’s evidence. The King questioned them as to
their hideous trade, and one man, a villainous-looking individual,
answered proudly, in reply to the question as to how many
people he had murdered, “Sixty-seven.”</p>

<p>King Edward and his suite left Bombay for home on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
13th March, just seventeen weeks after the <i>Serapis</i> had first
dropped anchor in Bombay harbour. During those four months
he had travelled close on 8000 miles by land and 2500 miles
by sea, and during that time he had become acquainted with
more Rajahs than had all the Viceroys who had ever reigned
over India, and he had seen more of the country than had any
living Englishman.</p>

<p>The intelligence that Queen Victoria was about to assume
the title of Empress of India had become known before the
<i>Serapis</i> left Bombay, and caused her son great gratification.
Curiously enough, the King met Lord Lytton, who was on his
way out to Hindustan to succeed Lord Northbrook as Viceroy,
when the <i>Serapis</i> was going through the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>The Royal party spent five days in Egypt. By 6th April
Malta was in sight, and the King was received there with great
enthusiasm, as was also the case at Gibraltar, where he had
the pleasure of meeting his brother, the Duke of Connaught.
From there the <i>Serapis</i> proceeded by easy stages round Spain,
the King taking the opportunity of visiting Seville, Cordova,
Madrid, the Escurial, Lisbon, and Cintra. At Madrid King
Alfonso came to meet the King at the station, and they drove
together to the Palace, going from there to Toledo in order
that the Royal visitor might inspect the famous manufactory
of Toledo blades.</p>

<p>As the <i>Serapis</i> anchored near Yarmouth the King was
informed that Queen Alexandra and the Royal children had
come to meet him on board the <i>Enchantress</i>. He immediately
went on board their ship, bringing Her Majesty and
their children back with him a little later on board the
<i>Serapis</i>.</p>

<p>It need hardly be pointed out that King Edward received
a very remarkable number of gifts during his tour in India.
The cost of a gift made to him by a native Prince was supposed
to be strictly limited to £2000 in value, but in many cases this
restriction was evaded by the present being priced at a nominal
sum, the real value being anything from £5000 to £30,000.
As an actual fact the splendid collection brought home by His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Majesty, which is his own personal property, is said to be
worth half a million sterling.</p>

<p>Some time after his return home the King kindly allowed
his Indian gifts to be exhibited to the public. They were
afterwards distributed between Marlborough House and
Sandringham, a considerable portion of them finding a resting-place
in the Indian room of Marlborough House. There also
were carefully stored away in solid silver cylinders all the
addresses received by the King during his eventful Indian tour.</p>

<p>King Edward, who takes the very keenest interest in live
animals, brought back quite a menagerie with him from India,
and the quarters in the <i>Serapis</i> assigned to his pets was for
the time being a veritable Zoo, for there were tigers, elephants,
ostriches, leopards, birds, ponies, cattle, monkeys, dogs and
horses, some of which spent a peaceful old age at Sandringham.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that from a political point of view
the tour was a great success, doing much indirectly to consolidate
the British power in India. It is also a curious commentary
on the objections raised by the economy party to the
visit that no less a sum than £250,000 was spent in London
alone by native Princes in buying presents for His Majesty.</p>

<p>The principal incident of the voyage home had been a farewell
dinner given by the officers of the <i>Serapis</i> to the King and
his suite when the vessel was nearing harbour.</p>

<p>The table was laid for forty on the main deck (called the
Windsor Long Walk), which was decorated with flags, trophies
of arms, and ornaments. After Queen Victoria had been duly
honoured, Captain Glyn proposed King Edward’s health, and
begged him to accept an album as a keepsake from himself and
his officers. It contained, besides a large photograph of every
officer, photographed groups of the men and the Guard of
Honour, views of different parts of the ship, and photographs
of a few favourite animals.</p>

<p>The real popularity of the King’s visit to India was significantly
proved by the popular demonstrations which awaited
him on his return. Enthusiastic greetings of welcome hailed
him in the evening both at Victoria Station and in his drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
round by Grosvenor Place, Piccadilly, and St. James’s Street
to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace. The appearance
of the King and Queen at the Royal Italian Opera in the
evening, within two hours of their reaching home, was a
particularly graceful act of consideration. Nothing could
surpass the enthusiasm with which they were greeted when
they were seen in the Royal box.</p>

<p><i>From a Drawing by Sargent</i></p>

</div>

<p>During the days that followed, their Majesties received
congratulatory visits from all the members of the Royal Family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
then in England, and from many distinguished personages.
On the Sunday after his return, King Edward, accompanied by
his Consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Duke of Connaught,
attended divine service at Westminster Abbey in
the afternoon, when special thanksgivings were offered up for
His Majesty’s safe return from India.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the King was entertained at a banquet and
ball given by the Corporation of the City of London at the
Guildhall. The temporary building erected for this brilliant
assembly, to which over five thousand were invited, occupied
the whole of Guildhall Yard. The reception hall was on the
basement floor, the ballroom being built above it, and was
beautifully decorated and draped with Oriental hangings. A
daïs had been erected for their Majesties; and the scene is
described as a combination of quaintly mediæval magnificence
with modern luxury and elegance. The reception ceremony
took place in the new library of the Guildhall, where an address
of welcome, in a golden casket of Indian design, was presented
to the King by the Lord Mayor. His Majesty, in a brief
reply, said that it was his highest reward and his greatest pride
to have received from the citizens of London and his countrymen
such a welcome at the termination of a visit which had
been undertaken with the view to strengthening the ties that
bound India to our common country. The invitation tickets
for this brilliant function were both beautiful and appropriate,
the Star of India and the Taj Mahal at Agra figuring prominently
in the design.</p>

<p>Among the other entertainments given in honour of the
King’s return may be mentioned a concert at the Albert Hall.
King Edward and Queen Alexandra on their arrival were
received by a Guard of Honour of 120 bluejackets from the
<i>Serapis</i>, the <i>Raleigh</i>, and the <i>Osborne</i>, under the command of
Captain Carr Glyn, and in the vestibule were all the Council
of the Albert Hall, wearing the Windsor uniform. At their
head was the Duke of Edinburgh in naval uniform. The vast
hall was crowded with a distinguished audience.</p>

<span class="smaller">QUIET YEARS OF PUBLIC WORK, 1876-1887&mdash;VISIT TO IRELAND&mdash;QUEEN
VICTORIA’S GOLDEN JUBILEE</span></h2>

<p>The year 1876 was marked, in addition to King Edward’s
return from India, by a curious example of His Majesty’s tact
and courage. He consented to preside at the special Jubilee
Festival of the Licensed Victuallers’ Asylum, and this action
aroused an extraordinary amount of feeling in temperance
circles. Before the day of the festival he had received more
than 200 petitions from all over the kingdom begging him to
withdraw his consent. His Majesty, however, attended the
festival, and in his speech pointedly referred to his critics,
observing that he was there, not to encourage the consumption
of alcoholic liquors, but to support an excellent charity, which
had enjoyed the patronage of his honoured father.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the manner in which King Edward
always refers to his father, with whom he undoubtedly has far
more in common than is generally supposed. Perhaps the
most conspicuous taste shared by the father and the son is a
really keen and personal interest in exhibitions of all kinds.
This was probably first realised by those about him twenty
years ago, when the King accepted the onerous duties of
Executive President of the British Commission of the Paris
Exhibition of 1878. He threw himself with ardour into this
work almost immediately after his return from India, and
during a short visit which he paid to France in that spring he
received a considerable number of official personages connected
with the approaching exhibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The King, accompanied by Queen Alexandra, unveiled in
the following July a statue of Alfred the Great at Wantage,
the birthplace of the famous King. The statue was the gift
of Colonel Lloyd-Lindsay (afterwards Lord Wantage), the
sculptor being Count Gleichen (Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg).
King Edward is a lineal descendant of King
Alfred by the intermarriage of the Saxon with the Norman
reigning houses in the eleventh century, and it was most
appropriate that he should have been invited to perform the
ceremony.</p>

<p>In January 1878 King Edward, accompanied by Prince
Louis Napoleon, visited the late Duke of Hamilton at Hamilton
Palace, in Lanarkshire. The Crown Prince of Austria was also
a guest of the Duke at the time. The King greatly enjoyed
this visit to the premier Peer of Scotland, who is of the ancient
lineage of Scottish Royalty. The Royal visitors enjoyed some
excellent sport in the historic Cadzow Forest&mdash;<i>Cadyow</i> having
been granted by King Robert the Bruce after the battle of
Bannockburn to Sir Gilbert Hamilton, the ancestor of the
present Duke. Here still remain the few old oaks of the once
great Caledonian Forest, immortalised by Sir Walter Scott in
his ballad of “Cadyow Castle”; and here are also the wild
white bulls of the same breed as preserved at Chillingham,
and the famous Cadzow herd of wild cattle.</p>

<p>This year of 1878, so brilliant in Paris, brought to the
British Royal family a bereavement which can only be compared
for its suddenness and bitterness with the death of the
Prince Consort. The Grand Duchess of Hesse (Princess
Alice), after nursing her children through a malignant diphtheria,
herself fell a victim to the same dread disease on the very
anniversary of her father’s death. The blow fell with peculiar
severity on the King and Queen Alexandra, with whom
Princess Alice had been united in the bonds of the closest affection,
especially since the King’s illness, in which she had proved
herself so devoted a nurse. The link between the Royal brother
and sister is significantly shown by the fact that Princess Alice
never visited England without paying long visits at Sandringham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
or at Marlborough House. The King was one of the chief
mourners at the funeral in Darmstadt.</p>

</div>

<p>After this blow the King and Queen naturally remained for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
some months in the deepest retirement. A new grief was,
however, in store for them&mdash;the tragic death in the following
June of the young Prince Imperial, in whose career the King had
always taken a warm and almost paternal interest. His Majesty
was among the very first in this country to be informed of the
terrible news, and he was of the greatest assistance to the
stricken Empress Eugénie in making the complicated arrangements
for the funeral. His active sympathy, and the announcement
that the heir to the British Crown intended to be the
principal pall-bearer of Napoleon III.’s ill-fated son, aroused
much comment on the Continent, and gave great satisfaction
to Frenchmen of all shades of political opinion. On a beautiful
wreath of violets which was sent from Marlborough House for
the funeral at Chislehurst were the words, written in Queen
Alexandra’s own hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A token of affection and regard for him who lived the
most spotless of lives and died a soldier’s death fighting for
our cause in Zululand.</p>

<p class="center">“From <span class="smcap">Albert Edward</span> and <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>,<br />
July 12, 1879.”</p>

</div>

<p>The King strongly supported the movement for erecting a
memorial to the Prince Imperial in Westminster Abbey, and
subscribed £130 to the fund which was raised for that object.
The opposition to the scheme was, however, so strong that it
fell to the ground. That the King’s feelings were not modified
in any way is shown by the fact that early in January 1883,
His Majesty, accompanied by his two sons, Prince Albert
Victor and Prince George, with the Duke of Edinburgh and
the Duke of Cambridge, unveiled a monument to the Prince
Imperial at Woolwich. This “United Service Memorial”
was erected by a subscription raised throughout all ranks of
the Army, Navy, Royal Marines, Militia, Yeomanry, and
Volunteers, and Count Gleichen was the sculptor. The
King, in a speech at the unveiling, commended the virtues,
the blameless life, the courage, and obedience to orders
manifested by the young Prince, as a bright example to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
young men entering the Military Academy, and remarked
that it was only a natural impulse which prompted his desire
to join his English comrades in the war in South Africa, in
which he fell fighting for the Queen of England.</p>

<p>In view of Princess Louise’s subsequent marriage it is
interesting to record that in the autumn of 1880 the King,
accompanied by Prince Leopold and Prince John of Glucksburg,
visited the Earl of Fife at Mar Lodge. On the evening
of their arrival Lord Fife gave a grand ball, at which his
distinguished visitors were present. The entertainment
included a torchlight procession and dance by the Duff
Highlanders. The party also enjoyed some deer-stalking in
the Forest of Mar.</p>

<p>An incident worth recording occurred in January 1881,
during a visit of the King and Queen to Normanton Park.
Queen Alexandra drove with Lady Aveland to Oakham, and
paid a visit to the ancient castle, on the inner walls of which
are nailed numerous horse-shoes, the gift, or rather the toll,
of various Royal and noble personages. A large horse-shoe
of steel, perfect in shape and of elegant workmanship, had
been made for the Queen to offer. Her Majesty examined
the other horse-shoes in the Castle hall, and chose the position
in which she desired her toll to be affixed, namely, over a large
one supposed to have been the gift of Queen Elizabeth. The
Queen greatly enjoyed following this ancient custom, a mark
of territorial power possessed for many centuries by the Ferrers
family, a shoe from the horse of every princely traveller who
passed that way being a tax due to the Ferrers or Farriers.
Among the horse-shoes specially noticed by Queen Alexandra
were one contributed by Queen Victoria before her accession,
on 2nd September 1833; another by the Duchess of Kent on
the same date; also one offered by the Prince Regent, afterwards
George IV., on 7th January 1814.</p>

<p>It was in this year that the King had an opportunity of
exhibiting in a public manner his strong interest in the British
Colonies, the welfare of which was not then so much a matter
of concern in the eyes of our statesmen as it is now. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
occasion was a dinner given to the members of the Colonial
Institute by the then Lord Mayor, Sir George MacArthur,
himself an old colonist. An extraordinary number of distinguished
men connected in various ways, official and other,
with our colonies were present. In his speech the King
pointed out that no function of the kind had ever taken place
before&mdash;a statement which seems hardly credible nowadays,
thanks in a great measure to His Majesty’s own unwearied
exertions in the interests of our colonial empire. The King
also alluded to his Canadian tour, and took the opportunity
of paying a graceful compliment to his friend Sir John
Macdonald, the Canadian statesman, who was present.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Very shortly after this dinner the King attended as patron
the first meeting ever held in this country of the International
Medical Congress.</p>

<p>King Edward was deeply grieved at the death of Dean
Stanley, with whom, as we have seen, he had been on terms of
close intimacy. At a meeting held in the Chapter-House of
Westminster Abbey, His Majesty paid a touching and eloquent
tribute to his dead friend’s rare qualities, both of heart and
intellect.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, this period of the King’s life was not
very eventful. His children were still quite young, and his
public appearances, though tolerably frequent, did not usually
possess more than a local importance. There were, however,
some conspicuous exceptions, which broke the even current of
his life. For example, it would be difficult to overestimate the
value of the work which His Majesty did in promoting the
International Fisheries Exhibition in 1883, which was visited
by nearly three million people, and may be said to have been
the first introduction into London of open-air entertainment on
a large scale. Moreover, it resulted in a clear profit of £15,000,
of which two-thirds was devoted to the relief of the orphan
families of fishermen.</p>

<p>The success of the Fisheries suggested to the King the
idea of another exhibition concerned with health and hygiene,
which was held in 1884, and was nicknamed the “Healtheries.”
Not long before it was opened the King and Queen Alexandra
suffered a great bereavement in the death of the Duke of
Albany, to whom their Majesties had always been very much
attached. He died quite suddenly in the south of France on
28th March, and the King instantly started for the Riviera and
brought his brother’s remains back to Windsor. In the following
July His Majesty, presiding at the festival of the Railway
Guards’ Friendly Society, took the opportunity of his first
appearance at a public dinner to express in the name of Queen
Victoria and the Royal Family their thanks for the public
sympathy shown on the death of the Duke of Albany.</p>

<p>In August of this year was celebrated the jubilee of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
abolition of slavery throughout the British dominions. The
King attended a meeting at the Mansion-House and delivered
a long and elaborate speech, evidently the result of much painstaking
study, in which he reviewed the whole history of the
anti-slavery movement.</p>

<p>The news of the fall of Khartoum came as a terrible shock
to the King, who had long watched with increasing interest
the career of General Gordon. Indeed, General Gordon had
always been one of His Majesty’s great heroes, and it was
chiefly owing to His Majesty’s initiative that a fund was
established for providing a national memorial to the hero of
Khartoum. At the first meeting of the committee the King
made a touching speech, in which he said of Gordon&mdash;</p>

<p>“His career as a soldier, as a philanthropist, and as a
Christian is a matter of history.… Many would wish for
some fine statue, some fine monument, but we who know
what Gordon was feel convinced that were he living nothing
would be more distasteful personally than that any memorial
should be erected in the shape of a statue or of any great
monument. His tastes were so simple and we all know he
was anxious that his name should not be brought prominently
before the public, though in every act of his life that name was
brought, I am inclined to think, as prominently before the
nation as that of any soldier or any great Englishman whom
we know of at the present time.”</p>

<p>It is well known that it was His Majesty’s suggestion that
a hospital and sanatorium should be founded in Egypt open to
persons of all nationalities. Queen Alexandra was present at
the special service held in St. Paul’s on 13th March, the day
of public mourning for the loss of General Gordon.</p>

<p>Three days later the King, accompanied by his eldest son,
presided at a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute, and
spoke of the personal as well as of the political interest he took
in everything that concerned the colonies. On the next day
Prince Albert Victor was initiated as a Freemason in the
presence of a large and most distinguished company, his father
receiving the Royal apprentice in his quality of Worshipful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Master of the Royal Alpha Lodge. On the following day the
King, Prince Albert Victor, and the Duke of Edinburgh went
to Berlin to congratulate the aged Emperor William on his
eighty-eighth birthday.</p>

<p>It had been decided, not without the most anxious consideration,
that the King and Queen, accompanied by their
elder son, should pay a visit to Ireland. The announcement
was received with the greatest excitement both in Ireland
and in America.</p>

<p><i>United Ireland</i>, the chief organ of the Nationalist party,
then edited by Mr. William O’Brien, and said to be largely
written by Mr. T. M. Healy, brought out a special number
devoted entirely to expressions of opinion from eminent
Irishmen of all kinds on the Royal visit. Every Nationalist
Member of Parliament, every prominent ecclesiastic, in a word,
every Irishman of conspicuous Nationalist views, was invited to
say what he thought of the forthcoming visit. The answers
filled a copious supplement, and their tenour was one of
unanimous disapproval, expressed in some cases strongly, and
in others in terms of studied moderation. Almost all the letters
agreed in counselling an attitude of absolute indifference to the
visit, but abstention from any kind of display of hostility to the
King himself was insisted on; and it was openly said that the
part which he was playing in this pageant was a more or less
passive one. This, perhaps, showed more than anything else
that has occurred during His Majesty’s life the personal liking
and respect in which he is held.</p>

<p>It may be added that when the King and Queen arrived
early in April 1885, the Nationalist party made no sign, but,
as there was naturally a great display of rejoicing on the part
of the Anti-nationalist citizens, the Press, perhaps unfortunately,
chose to regard this reception as a proof that the Home Rulers
were wholly discredited. The Nationalist leaders therefore
made up their minds that it was necessary to make some
protest against the Royal progress as an answer to these
taunts, and accordingly, from Mallow till the Royal party left
Ireland, they were the victims of some very unpleasing demonstrations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and at Cork collisions occurred between the police
and the mob, though no serious injuries were reported on
either side.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting event of the tour was when,
after laying the foundation-stone of the New Science and Art
Museum and National Library of Ireland in Dublin on 10th
April, their Majesties attended the Royal University of Ireland,
and the degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on the King,
and that of Doctor of Music on Queen Alexandra. Her Majesty
has always been passionately fond of music, and the distinction
gave her special gratification.</p>

<p>The Colonial and Indian Exhibition, called for short the
“Colinderies,” may be said to have been the most successful
of all those with which the King was intimately associated.
It was opened by Queen Victoria on 4th May 1886, and Her
Majesty was received by the King, and Queen Alexandra, His
Majesty conducting his mother to the daïs. In the Royal
Albert Hall, where the opening ceremony took place, everything
was done to make the scene as impressive and interesting
as possible; and at the special desire of the King, Lord
Tennyson wrote an Ode for the occasion, which was set to
music by Sir Arthur Sullivan and sung by Madame Albani
in the choir. This exhibition resulted in a net surplus of
£35,000.</p>

<p>In September some correspondence between King Edward
and the Lord Mayor, suggesting the establishment of a Colonial
and Indian Institute to commemorate the Queen’s Jubilee, was
published, and excited a great deal of interest both at home
and in the Colonies. A public subscription was opened at the
Mansion-House; and later in the same month His Majesty,
having been informed that a movement was on foot to present
him with a testimonial in recognition of his services in connection
with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, wrote to request
that any fund subscribed might be devoted to the furtherance
of the Imperial Institute, and a great deal of his time that
autumn was dedicated to this scheme.</p>

</div>

<p>The King in 1886 also gave his patronage to two great
engineering achievements, by opening the Mersey Tunnel and
by laying the first stone of the Tower Bridge. It is interesting
to note in this connection that His Majesty has long been an
honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and
when he attended their annual dinner in the same year, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
made an amusing speech, in which he attempted to picture
what sort of a world ours would be without engineers.</p>

<p>One of the busiest years ever spent by the King and
Queen Alexandra was 1887, when Queen Victoria’s Golden
Jubilee was celebrated. To His Majesty was left the responsibility
of a great number of the arrangements, and on him fell
almost entirely the reception and entertainment of the foreign
Royal personages who attended the splendid ceremony in the
Abbey as Queen Victoria’s guests. In many cases the King
was obliged to welcome in person the Royal visitor to London,
and he was indefatigable in his efforts to make everything go
off as smoothly and successfully as possible, while it need
hardly be said that he took a very prominent part next to
Queen Victoria in all the Jubilee functions.</p>

<p>It was in this year that His Majesty was appointed
Honorary Admiral of the Fleet, a distinction which gave him
much gratification, for it was his first definite official link with
the sea service which he had selected as the profession of his
younger son, and in which his elder son had received an early
training&mdash;a link which was destined to be still further strengthened
after His Majesty’s accession, as will be related hereafter.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">SILVER WEDDING OF KING EDWARD AND QUEEN ALEXANDRA&mdash;ENGAGEMENT
AND MARRIAGE OF PRINCESS LOUISE</span></h2>

<p>Considerable preparations were made early in 1888 for the
Silver Wedding of King Edward and Queen Alexandra, but
it was well known that the Royal family were expecting daily
to hear of the death of the old German Emperor, William I.,
which actually occurred just before the Silver Wedding Day,
and everything in the way of public rejoicing was countermanded.
Still, the 10th of March was not allowed to pass
entirely unobserved. The whole of the Royal family then in
England, preceded by Queen Victoria, called at Marlborough
House to offer their congratulations in person, and for that
one day the Court mourning was abandoned. The King and
Queen Alexandra with their family lunched at Buckingham
Palace with Queen Victoria, while in the evening the Sovereign
attended a family dinner-party at Marlborough House, this
being the first time she had ever been to dinner with her son
and daughter-in-law in London. Queen Victoria, after leaving
Marlborough House, drove through some of the principal West
End streets in order to see the illuminations. Her Majesty
also gave a State ball at Buckingham Palace in honour of the
event, and the King and Queen of Denmark gave a grand
ball at the Amalienborg Palace at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Archbishop Magee (then Bishop of Peterborough) writes
in a letter to his intimate friend and biographer, Canon
MacDonnell, the following amusing account of his share in
the rejoicings:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Athenæum Club</span>, <i>11th March 1888</i>.</p>

<p>“Did you ever in your eminently respectable life dance on
the tight rope? And did you ever do so in the presence of
Royalty? No? Then I have beaten you.</p>

<p>“For I have this day performed that exceedingly difficult
feat, and dead beat do I feel after it. I suppose you saw (for
it was announced in all the papers) that H.R.H. was to worship
at Whitehall with all his family, to keep his silver wedding,
and that the Bishop of Peterborough was to preach. Not an
easy thing to do, under any circumstances, to preach to Royalty
in a pew opposite you, and also to a large middle-class
congregation on a special occasion. But only think of having
to add to this a special allusion to the late Emperor of
Germany’s death, and the present Emperor’s condition, and
all this within the space of forty minutes, the utmost length
that it is considered good taste to inflict on H.R.H. Add to
this that he specially requested an offertory for the Gordon
Boys’ Home, and of course implied some reference in the
sermon to this. So that I had, within forty minutes, to preach
a charity sermon, a wedding sermon, and a funeral one.
Match me that if you can for difficulty.…”</p>

</div>

<p>In the unavoidable absence of the Bishop of London, Dean
of the Chapels-Royal, the Archbishop of Canterbury was
present, His Grace finally receiving the alms and giving the
benediction. On the desk in the Royal Closet, in front of
Queen Alexandra, was placed a beautiful bouquet of lilies of
the valley, the emblem of the See and Province of Canterbury.
Her Majesty quitted the chapel carrying the bouquet.</p>

<p>An enormous number of presents testified to the wide
affection and respect in which the Royal couple were held.
King Edward gave his wife a cross of diamonds and rubies,
her favourite jewels; and from St. Petersburg, as a joint gift
of the Emperor and Empress of Russia, came a superb necklace
of the same gems composed of carefully selected stones.
The five children of Queen Alexandra gave her a silver model
of “Viva,” her favourite mare. Her Majesty’s eight bridesmaids,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
who were all alive and all married, gave the Royal bride
of 1863 their autographs bound up in a silver book enshrined
in a silver casket of Danish work.</p>

<p>The Freemasons of Great Britain presented Queen Alexandra
with a very splendid diamond butterfly. The members
of the Body-Guard were represented by a silver statue of a
member of the corps, arrayed in the uniform originally designed
by the Prince Consort. The Comte de Paris sent a large
agate punch-bowl, studded with precious stones. Among the
public gifts which afforded the King and Queen most pleasure
was the Colonial Silver Wedding gift&mdash;a silver candelabrum
adapted for electric light, and a fine twenty-one day
movement clock to match. The Colonies became very enthusiastic
over this gift, and more than £2000 was subscribed
in small sums.</p>

<p>The King and Queen of Denmark gave a silver-gilt tea
and coffee service; the Crown Prince and Princess of Denmark,
a valuable vase of Danish china; the Empress Eugénie,
a silver model of a two-masted ship of the time of Henry
VIII.; and the King of the Belgians, a large silver tankard
and a collection of the choicest exotics from the gardens at
Laeken. The Austrian Ambassador presented an autograph
letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph announcing that King
Edward had been appointed to the Honorary Colonelcy of the
12th Hussar Regiment in the Austro-Hungarian Army. The
French Ambassador was also received in audience, and offered
an expression of good wishes on the part of the President of
the French Republic and the French Government.</p>

<p>The presents received by the King and Queen were
arranged in the Indian Room at Marlborough House. A
prominent position was accorded to the gift from Queen
Victoria&mdash;a massive silver flagon of goodly height and proportions,
the counterpart of one in the Kremlin. One corner
of the Indian Room was filled with floral gifts, bouquets,
wreaths, pyramids of lilies of the valley, and rich and rare
exotics, sent by all classes of the community from all parts of
the country and from the Continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>In strong contrast to these rejoicings was the deep shadow
thrown over King Edward and his family by the serious illness
of the Emperor Frederick. All the arrangements of their
Majesties were naturally dependent on the news received
almost hourly from the sick-chamber at Potsdam, but even
in the midst of his terrible anxieties the King did not disappoint
the loyal citizens of Glasgow, whose Exhibition he
had promised to open, and who gave him a right Royal
welcome. At length the long-dreaded blow fell. On 14th
June the Emperor Frederick breathed his last after a reign
of ninety-nine days.</p>

<p>The following year was notable for the first break in the
King’s own family circle caused by marriage. But before the
engagement of Princess Louise to the Earl of Fife was publicly
announced, Queen Victoria paid one of her necessarily rare
visits to Sandringham, spending altogether four days there.
While there Her Majesty witnessed a performance of <i>The Bells</i>
and of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, given by Sir Henry Irving
and the members of the Lyceum Company. The King’s
tenants presented an address of welcome to his Royal mother,
to which Queen Victoria gave the following gracious reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It has given me great pleasure to receive your loyal
address, and I thank you sincerely for the terms in which you
welcome me to Sandringham, and for the kind expressions
which you have used towards the Prince and Princess of Wales.
After the anxious time I spent here seventeen years ago, when,
by the blessing of God, my dear son was spared to me and
to the nation, it is indeed a pleasure to find myself here again,
among cheerful homes and cheerful faces, and to see the kind
feeling which exists between a good landlord and a good
tenant; and I trust that this mutual attachment and esteem
may long continue to make you happy and prosperous, and to
strengthen, if possible, the affection of the Prince and Princess
of Wales for the tenants of Sandringham.”</p>

<p>Although Great Britain was not officially represented at

<p>Princess Louise’s engagement was made public in the
spring, and though it aroused almost as much surprise as
satisfaction among the general public, yet those who were
really in a position to know regarded it as the most natural
thing in the world. Lord Fife had for years been admitted
to the close intimacy of the King’s family circle. His was the
only bachelor’s house at which Queen Alexandra had ever
been entertained, he had long been a frequent and welcome
guest at Sandringham, and when he took the oath and his
seat in the House of Lords, the King had paid him the rare
honour of appearing as one of his introducers. Although
rumours of the betrothal of the King’s eldest daughter to
various foreign Princes had for some time been rife, His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Majesty had made no secret of the special importance which he
attached to her marriage, for at that time it appeared by no
means impossible that the Princess herself or her children
might one day sit on the British throne. In these circumstances
a foreign marriage of the particular kind which then
seemed intrinsically probable would have been frankly unpopular
with the British people, who would have pictured
themselves as being perhaps one day reduced to bringing
back their Queen, now wholly Germanised, from some obscure
Grand Duchy.</p>

<p>King Edward on this occasion showed once more his intuitive
sympathy with the feelings of his future subjects, for
the news of the Royal engagement was received with an
absolutely unforced outburst of popular enthusiasm, the more
so when it became known that it was entirely a love match.</p>

<p>The King and Queen Alexandra with their three daughters
went to Windsor on 27th June and visited Queen Victoria, who
formally gave her consent to the engagement. On the receipt
of the news at Marlborough House the fact was at once communicated
to the Household, and the Marquis of Salisbury,
the Prime Minister, was also officially informed. The Earl
of Fife was received by Queen Victoria the same evening at
Windsor Castle. In the House of Commons a Message from
the Queen formally announced the intended marriage, and the
First Lord of the Treasury gave notice of a motion to grant a
suitable provision for the Royal bride, though owing to the
great wealth of the bridegroom this was perhaps less necessary
than it had been on the occasion of other Royal marriages.</p>

<p>The Earl of Fife (Alexander William George Duff), Baron
Skene of Skene, Viscount Macduff, and Baron Braco of Kilbryde,
County Cavan, was the only son of James, fifth Earl of
Fife, and of the Countess of Fife, who was Lady Agnes
Georgiana Elizabeth Hay, daughter of the Earl of Erroll.
He was born on 10th November 1849, and was educated
at Eton. He succeeded his father in the Scotch and Irish
honours on 7th August 1879, and was created an Earl of the
United Kingdom in 1885. He sat as Viscount Macduff in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the House of Commons from 1874 to 1879 as Liberal member
for Elgin and Nairn. Lord Fife, who is one of the largest
landed proprietors in Scotland, owning extensive estates in
Elgin, Banff, and Aberdeen, was created Duke of Fife and
Marquis of Macduff in the peerage of the United Kingdom,
on his wedding day, 27th July, having declined to take the
title of Duke of Inverness.</p>

<p>The wedding was celebrated in the Chapel at Buckingham
Palace, in the presence of Queen Victoria, King Edward, and
Queen Alexandra, with their sons and two younger daughters,
the King of the Hellenes, the Crown Prince of Denmark, and
the Grand Duke of Hesse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The King of the Hellenes has always been one of the
favourite brothers-in-law of the King, who, with Queen
Alexandra, went to Athens in the autumn to attend the
wedding of the Duke of Sparta and Princess Sophie of
Germany.</p>

<p>The following year was not very eventful. In March the
King performed the ceremonies of finishing and opening the
Forth Bridge in the presence of an illustrious assembly, including
his son Prince George, the Duke of Edinburgh, who
had travelled from Russia on purpose, the Duke of Fife, and
the Earl of Rosebery, who entertained the Royal party at
Dalmeny. The last rivet, which the King fixed, is on the
outside of the railway, and holds together three plates.
Around its gilded top there runs a commemorative inscription.
At the hour appointed for the formal declaration of the
opening of the bridge, the wind was blowing so violently that
it was impossible for His Majesty to make a speech. He
simply said, “Ladies and Gentlemen, I now declare the Forth
Bridge open.”</p>

<p>It was in March, also, that the King and Prince George
attended a Chapter of the Order of the Black Eagle in Berlin,
at which Prince George was invested with the insignia of the
Order. Subsequently the Royal visitors took part in the
Ordensfest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BACCARAT CASE&mdash;BIRTH OF LADY ALEXANDRA DUFF&mdash;THE
KING’S FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY&mdash;ILLNESS OF PRINCE GEORGE</span></h2>

<p>During the winter of 1890 various rumours had been rife as
to a <i>cause célèbre</i> in which King Edward was to be called as
a witness. These reports proved to have had substantial
foundation in the following spring, when Sir William Gordon-Cumming,
a cavalry officer of good family, who had distinguished
himself in the Egyptian campaign, and was understood
to enjoy the personal friendship of the King, brought an action
for slander against five defendants&mdash;Mrs. Arthur Wilson, Mrs.
A. S. Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. Lycett Green, and Mr. Berkeley
Levett&mdash;who had accused him of cheating at baccarat at
Tranby Croft, the Wilsons’ place near Hull.</p>

<p>The trial opened early in June before Lord Chief-Justice
Coleridge, and the King was accommodated with a seat on the
bench. The Court throughout wore the air of a theatre rather
than of a Court of Justice, the bench and both the galleries
being filled with ladies, who used their opera-glasses with
freedom to discover the notable personages in Court, and to
watch Sir William Gordon-Cumming under examination. The
great counsel of the day were engaged. Sir Edward Clarke
(Solicitor-General), with Mr. C. F. Gill as his junior, conducted
the case for Sir William Gordon-Cumming; and Sir Charles
Russell (afterwards Lord Chief-Justice), with Mr. Asquith,
appeared for the defendants, the Attorney-General having
withdrawn from the case.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General made a speech of singular power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
skill on behalf of his client. The point of the defence was that
Sir William Gordon-Cumming&mdash;who was accused of the trick
known as <i>la poussette</i>, by which a player at baccarat increases
his stake after he sees that the cards are in his favour or the
<i>coup</i> has been declared&mdash;had simply been playing on a system.
This theory Sir William supported in the witness-box with
great steadiness, and though his cross-examination was most
severe, he maintained that on no occasion had he wrongfully
increased the stake. When the cross-examiner came to a
document which the plaintiff had signed, practically admitting
his guilt, and which had been witnessed by the King, Sir
William’s explanation was, in effect, that he was hopeless of
convincing those round him of his innocence, and that he
desired for his own sake and that of others to avoid a
scandal.</p>

<p>King Edward entered the witness-box and was sworn in
the ordinary way on the second day. Sir Edward Clarke
addressed him as “Sir” and “Your Royal Highness,” and
Sir Charles Russell did the same. His Majesty gave his
evidence with much frankness, but it was largely of a formal
character. He did, however, say that at the time when, as
banker, he questioned Sir William Gordon-Cumming on the
largeness of his winnings, he did not think he had been
cheating; but he added, in cross-examination by Sir Charles
Russell, that in advising Sir William Gordon-Cumming to
sign the document, he considered he had been acting most
leniently.</p>

<p>As the King was leaving the witness-box an amusing
incident occurred. A juryman rose from the back of the jury-box,
and with <i>naïf</i> frankness put two important questions&mdash;whether
the King had ever seen Sir William Gordon-Cumming
cheating, and whether he believed him to be guilty. In reply
to the first question the King answered that the banker
would not be in a position to see foul play, and that among
friends it would not be expected; and to the second he replied
that, Sir William’s accusers being so numerous, he could not
but believe them. Having elicited these very important facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the little juryman sat down, and the King left the box with a
smile and a bow.</p>

<p>The King’s evidence was followed by that of General
Owen Williams, who, with Lord Coventry, drew up the
document signed by the plaintiff. General Williams made
two important statements&mdash;that he believed Sir William guilty,
and that the King had objected to his placing his hands on
the table in such a way that the counters could not properly
be seen. In the course of the evidence it came out that the
stakes played for on the two evenings were not large, but that
Sir William won in all £225, which was paid him by cheque
and which he retained.</p>

<p>The trial lasted seven days, and on 9th June the jury,
after ten minutes’ deliberation, returned a verdict for the
defendants.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary interest was taken in the case, both
in this country and on the Continent and in America, no doubt
chiefly owing to the Heir-Apparent’s connection with it. A
Prince of Wales has rarely been called as a witness in a case,
although, of course, in the theory of English law, all men are
equal, and the privileges, if any, which would attach to him
would not attach to him in his capacity as Prince of Wales or
Heir-Apparent to the Throne, but simply in his capacity as a
peer of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>It was pointed out by many that the conduct attributed to
Sir William Gordon-Cumming was obviously not that of an
officer and a gentleman, and in the House of Commons a week
after the trial the Secretary of State for War expressed the
regret of the King that he had not required Sir William to
submit his case to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The criticism which was directed against the King’s connection
with this lamentable business was largely based on
ignorance of all the circumstances. His Majesty’s own view
is clearly stated in a private letter which he wrote about two
months afterwards to his old friend Dr. Benson, who was then
Archbishop of Canterbury, and which was first published in
that prelate’s life, some years later. King Edward wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Archbishop</span>&mdash;Your kind letter of the 10th
instant has touched me very much, as I know the kind feelings
which prompted you to write to me on a subject which we have
discussed together, and which you are aware has caused me
deep pain and annoyance.</p>

<p>“A recent trial, which no one deplores more than I do,
and which I was powerless to prevent, gave occasion for the
Press to make most bitter and unjust attacks on me,
knowing that I was defenceless, and I am not sure that politics
were not mixed up in it! The whole matter has now died out,
and I think therefore it would be inopportune for me in any
public manner to allude again to the painful subject which
brought such a torrent of abuse upon me not only by the Press
but by the Low Church, and especially the Nonconformists.</p>

<p>“Horse-racing may produce gambling or it may not, but I
have always looked upon it as a manly sport which is popular
with Englishmen of all classes, and there is no reason why it
should be looked upon as a gambling transaction. Alas! those
who gamble will gamble at anything. I have written quite
openly to you, my dear Archbishop, whom I have had the
advantage of knowing for so many years.</p>

</div>

<p>The King became a grandfather for the first time this
spring, for on 17th May the Duchess of Fife gave birth to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
daughter at East Sheen Lodge. The question was immediately
raised whether the infant should take Royal rank as a Princess
of the Blood. When Sir William Beechey painted his portrait
of Princess Victoria, the distance between the Duke of Kent’s
little daughter and the throne was as great as, or even greater
than, that of the little daughter of Princess Louise at her birth.
It was ultimately settled, in accordance with the wishes, it was
understood, of both King Edward and the Duke of Fife, that
the infant should simply take the rank and precedence of a
Duke’s daughter, and be called Lady Alexandra Duff.</p>

<p>The child was christened on 29th June in the Chapel-Royal,
St. James’s. Queen Victoria came to London to act as sponsor
to her great-granddaughter, and King Edward and Queen
Alexandra were joint sponsors for their grandchild. The
Archbishop of Canterbury administered the rite of baptism.
Queen Alexandra took the child from the nurse and placed her
in the arms of Queen Victoria, who gave the names of Alexandra
Victoria Alberta Edwina Louise.</p>

<p>This autumn the King celebrated his fiftieth birthday, and
it was computed that in his half-century of existence His
Majesty must have been prayed for aloud in Anglican churches
alone at least a hundred million times. On this occasion the
theatrical managers of London presented a magnificent gold
cigar-box, weighing 100 ounces, to His Majesty.</p>

<p>The month of December has been one of peculiar ill-omen
to the Royal Family, and it seemed as if December 1891
was to prove no exception. For Queen Alexandra and her
daughters, who had been to Livadia on a visit to the Tsar,
were recalled by the illness of Prince George, and the King
and Queen went through some days of terrible anxiety. As
soon as Prince George was declared to be suffering from enteric
fever he was removed from Sandringham to London, and it was
there that he was nursed. The illness evoked a remarkable
degree of public sympathy, though perhaps the serious nature
of the Prince’s condition was hardly realised till all danger was
practically over.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DUKE OF CLARENCE AND AVONDALE</span></h2>

<p>The year 1892 opened auspiciously both for the Royal family
and the nation, inasmuch as, immediately on the convalescence
of Prince George, the engagement of his elder brother, the
Duke of Clarence and Avondale, to Princess Victoria Mary of
Teck was announced. The projected alliance was received
with every possible expression of popular approval. The
public career of the Duke of Clarence, short as it had been,
had already confirmed him in the public estimation as a worthy
son of his father, who was known to have actively superintended
the whole course of his education. A significant
proof of the young Prince’s amiability and unpretending
modesty was to be found in the large number of personal
friends whom he attached to himself, both at Cambridge and
among his comrades of the 10th Hussars, by ties of sincere
esteem. Moreover, it was generally known that between the
Duke of Clarence and his mother there existed the strongest
possible link of filial and maternal love, and so the Prince came
to share in a measure the high place which Queen Alexandra
has always held in the hearts of the British people.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the mournful event which threw a
gloom over the whole winter of 1892 are still fresh in the
memory of the nation. On 9th January the Duke of Clarence,
who was spending the Christmas holidays with his parents at
Sandringham, was attacked with influenza, having caught cold
at the funeral of Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.</p>

</div>

<p>Two days later the late Duchess of Teck wrote to Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Salisbury a letter which pathetically reflects the anxiety prevailing
at Sandringham:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sandringham</span>, <i>January 11, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“… After Sir Francis Knollys’s letter and the anxious
tidings in this morning’s papers you will not be surprised to
hear from me that we feel we must ask you and dear Lord
Salisbury to let us postpone the so-looked-forward-to visit
until we can really enjoy it; for although I hope and believe
dear Eddy is doing as well as can be expected at this stage
of this fearful illness, I cannot conceal from you that we are
very anxious, and must continue so until the crisis is over and
the inflammation has begun to subside. His strength is very
fairly maintained; the night was a tolerable one; he has two
admirable nurses, and both Doctors Broadbent and Laking
[now Sir William Broadbent and Sir Francis Laking] are
attending him; so that Eddy has every care, and with youth
on his side and God’s blessing, I trust we may soon see him
on the road to recovery, and who knows?&mdash;perhaps even our
visit to Hatfield may yet come off before you move to London.
As at present arranged we stay on here until Wednesday or
so; but, of course, everything depends on the progress the
dear patient (a <i>most exemplary one</i>, the Doctors say) makes.
May is wonderfully good and calm, but it is terribly trying for
her.…”</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the most devoted care and the most skilful
nursing, the Prince passed away on the 14th, within a week of
the day on which the tidings of his illness had first gone forth.
Then, if ever, King Edward and Queen Alexandra must have
realised the respect and affection with which they are regarded
by the British people. Their Majesties received the most
touching letters from all over the world. One of those they
most valued was from the Zulu chiefs at St. Helena. This
was conveyed to the Prince through Miss Colenso, and ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>“We have heard of the death of Prince Edward, the son
of the Prince of Wales. We lament sincerely. Pray you
present our lamentation to them all&mdash;to his grandmother, to
his father and his mother, and his brother.”</p>

<p>Their Majesties showed how deeply they appreciated the
sympathy so spontaneously offered to them on every side by
publishing the following Message:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>20th January 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“The Prince and Princess of Wales are anxious to express
to Her Majesty’s subjects, whether in the United Kingdom, in
the Colonies, or in India, the sense of their deep gratitude for
the universal feeling of sympathy manifested towards them at
a time when they are overwhelmed by the terrible calamity
which they have sustained in the loss of their beloved eldest
son. If sympathy at such a moment is of any avail, the
remembrance that their grief has been shared by all classes
will be a lasting consolation to their sorrowing hearts, and if
possible will make them more than ever attached to their dear
country.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Benson) was at Biskra
when he heard of the lamentable death of the Duke of
Clarence. The Archbishop wished to return home at once,
and in sending a telegram of condolence to the bereaved father
he stated his intention of so doing, but King Edward, with his
usual kindly consideration, telegraphed to him that he was on
no account to curtail his holiday. The telegram was followed
by this letter, which is given in the Archbishop’s Life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sandringham, Norfolk</span>, <i>27th January 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Archbishop</span>&mdash;Only a short time ago I received
such a kind letter from you, in which you agreed to perform the
marriage ceremony at St. George’s for our eldest son. Since
then I have received another letter from you containing such
kind and sympathetic words, in which you expressed a desire
to return home to take part in his Funeral Service.</p>

<p>“It was like yourself, kind and thoughtful as you always
are, but I could not allow you to undertake that long journey
and return to our cold climate and to an atmosphere still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
impregnated with that dire disease when your absence abroad
in a warmer climate is so essential for your health and strength.</p>

<p>“It has pleased God to inflict a heavy, crushing blow upon
us&mdash;that we can hardly realise the terrible loss we have
sustained. We have had the good fortune of receiving you
here in our country home on more than one occasion, and
you know what a happy family party we have always been,
so that the wrenching away of our first-born son under such
peculiarly sad circumstances is a sorrow, the shadow of which
can never leave us during the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>“He was just twenty-eight; on this day month he was to
have married a charming and gifted young lady, so that the
prospect of a life of happiness and usefulness lay before him.
Alas! that is all over. His bride has become his widow
without ever having been his wife.</p>

<p>“The ways of the Almighty are inscrutable, and it is not for
us to murmur, as He does all for the best, and our beloved son
is happier now than if he were exposed to the miseries and
temptations of this world. We have also a consolation in the
sympathy not only of our kind friends but of all classes.</p>

<p>“<i>God’s will be done!</i></p>

<p>“Again thanking you, my dear and kind Archbishop, for
your soothing letter, which has been such a solace to us in
our grief, I remain, yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Albert Edward</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the Sunday following the death of the Duke a private
service was held in Sandringham Church, attended by King
Edward and Queen Alexandra, their daughters, Princess
Victoria Mary of Teck, and Prince George. By the King’s
special wish his elder son was given the simplest of military
funerals, and the coffin was removed from Sandringham to
Windsor on a gun-carriage, escorted by a number of the
Prince’s old comrades in arms. On the coffin lay the Prince’s
busby and a silken Union Jack, and even at Windsor, where
among the impressive mass of mourners every Royal House
was represented, everything was severely simple, and the pall-bearers
were officers of the 10th Hussars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The career of the Prince, so suddenly cut off ere he had
well reached his prime, in addition to its historical interest,
throws an instructive light on the pains which King Edward
has always expended on the education and training of his
children. On none of his children did the King bestow more
loving thought and care than on his eldest son, who was
destined, as it then seemed, one day to bear all the anxieties
and responsibilities of the British Crown.</p>

<p>Prince Albert Victor was popularly, but quite erroneously,
supposed to be a weakly, delicate child. The two nurses who
successively had the principal charge of him&mdash;Mrs. Clark and
Mrs. Blackburn&mdash;agreed in repudiating this idea, and their
testimony is certainly supported by the photographs which
were taken of the Prince in babyhood. His early death is to
be attributed, not to any original delicacy of constitution, but
to the weakness following a severe attack of typhoid, which
delayed by two months his joining the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>Once out of the nursery, the brothers were committed to
the charge of a tutor selected for them by Queen Victoria&mdash;the
Rev. John Neale Dalton&mdash;an admirable choice as events
proved. From childhood Prince Albert Victor was devotedly
attached to his younger brother, Prince George, who warmly
reciprocated his affection, and their father wisely determined
that the two boys should not be separated, but should enter
the Royal Navy together as cadets. This was done in June
1877, Prince Albert Victor being then thirteen and a half and
Prince George being some seventeen months younger. From
the very first King Edward caused it to be understood that his
sons were to enjoy no privileges on account of their rank, but
were to be treated exactly like their fellow-cadets on board the
<i>Britannia</i>, and made to learn their profession just as if they
had been the sons of an ordinary private gentleman. The
only exceptions were that Mr. Dalton attended the Princes as
governor, and that, by special request of the Admiralty, their
hammocks were slung behind a separate bulkhead in a space
about 12 feet square. The young Princes spent two years in
the <i>Britannia</i>, and both obtained a first-class in seamanship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
entitling them to three months’ sea-time, and for general good
conduct they obtained another three months.</p>

<p>The King thoroughly realised the benefit he had himself derived
from the travels which he had undertaken as a youth, and
therefore he arranged that his sons should spend three years
in making a tour round the world, that their minds might be
equipped by experience of men and cities, and that they might
acquire an abiding impression of the extent and resources of
the British Empire. Accordingly, the young Princes started
in the <i>Bacchante</i> cruiser, Captain Lord Charles Scott, being
again entrusted to the care of Mr. Dalton, who was afterwards
made a Canon of Windsor. Canon Dalton, it is interesting to
note, attended Prince George when, as Duke of Cornwall and
York, and accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall and York,
he visited Australia to inaugurate the Federal Parliament,
coming home by New Zealand and Canada.</p>

<p>The Princes kept careful diaries, and on their return they
published a detailed account of their experiences. In the
<i>Bacchante</i>, just as in the <i>Britannia</i>, they were treated exactly
like other officers of their age and standing, except that they
had a private cabin under the poop. They joined the gun-room
mess, the members of which were granted a special
allowance&mdash;an arrangement which had before been made
when the Duke of Edinburgh began his naval career.</p>

<p>The <i>Bacchante</i> cruised to Gibraltar, Messina, Gibraltar
again, Madeira, the West Indies, and home to Spithead on
3rd May. Then, on 19th July, the Princes rejoined the
<i>Bacchante</i> for another cruise, first with the combined Channel
and Reserve Squadrons to Bantry Bay and Vigo, and afterwards
to Monte Video. The ship arrived off the Falkland
Islands, but the Princes never landed, as had been arranged,
for the troubles in South Africa had come to a head and the
squadron was suddenly ordered to the Cape. The <i>Bacchante</i>
reached Simons Bay on 16th February, and not many days
later came the news of Majuba Hill and Laing’s Nek.</p>

<p>Early in April the Princes left for Australia, a voyage
which was destined to be not without danger, for the <i>Bacchante</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
broke a portion of her steering-gear in a heavy gale. Temporary
repairs were effected, and the vessel’s course was altered
for Albany, in Western Australia. While the <i>Bacchante</i> was
refitting, their Royal Highnesses visited the chief Australian
ports in a passenger steamer called the <i>Cathay</i>, being everywhere
received with enthusiastic loyalty. At last, rejoining
the <i>Bacchante</i>, they said good-bye with regret to Australia,
and on the voyage home they visited Fiji, Japan (where they
were received with great ceremony by the Mikado), Shanghai,
Hong-Kong, Singapore, and Colombo. Thence they proceeded
to Suez, where they had the pleasure of meeting the
great de Lesseps, and went in the Khedive’s yacht on a trip
up to the First Cataract, as their parents had done in 1869.</p>

<p>A somewhat prolonged tour in the Holy Land followed, their
Royal Highnesses visiting those sacred scenes which their
father had visited before they were born. The Princes left
Beirut for Athens on 7th May, and there they had the pleasure
of meeting their uncle, the King of the Hellenes, and thence
they went to Suda Bay to take part in a naval regatta, in which
the <i>Bacchante’s</i> boats covered themselves with glory. By way
of Sicily and Sardinia, the Princes passed on to Gibraltar,
there renewing their old acquaintance with the famous Lord
Napier of Magdala. It is a pathetic circumstance that both
Lord Napier and, but two years afterwards, the Duke of
Clarence and Avondale, were borne to the grave on the same
gun-carriage.</p>

<p>At length the long voyage came to an end. Off Swanage
the <i>Osborne</i>, with King Edward, Queen Alexandra, and the
three young Princesses, met the <i>Bacchante</i> early in August. A
visit to Queen Victoria at Osborne followed, and the two
Princes were shortly afterwards confirmed in Whippingham
Church by Archbishop Tait, who said to them in his address:&mdash;</p>

<p>“From this time forward your course of life, which has been
hitherto unusually alike, must, in many respects, diverge. You
will have different occupations and different training for an
expected difference of position.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Archbishop was a true prophet. It was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
necessary now to separate the brothers. Prince George, as
the younger son, might be left to continue his career in the
noble service to which he had become devoted, but his elder
brother, being in the immediate succession to the Throne,
must, it was felt, be associated, as his father had been before
him, with other walks of national life as well. First of all, it
was decided, must come some terms at Cambridge University,
and to prepare Prince Albert Victor in the particular kind of
knowledge required Mr. J. K. Stephen was associated with Mr.
Dalton in the summer of 1883. Mr. Stephen, the son of one
of the greatest Judges who ever adorned the English Bench&mdash;Sir
James Fitz-James Stephen&mdash;was not merely a most lovable
man, possessed of extraordinary intellectual powers, but his total
personality was of so rare a kind as to be indescribable to those
who never came under its conquering influence. Probably
from no human being were all things mean and paltry so utterly
alien. Large in heart and mind as he was large in bodily frame,
he left, when an untimely death snatched him away, not only a
bitter personal grief among his friends, but a conviction that
the nation’s loss was even greater than theirs.</p>

<p>Prince Albert Victor became warmly attached to Mr.
Stephen, who gives in some private letters, quoted in Mr. J. E.
Vincent’s memoir of the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, a
characteristic picture of the life led by the Royal pupil and his
tutors in a little house in the park at Sandringham.</p>

<p>“He is a good-natured, unaffected youth,” writes Mr.
Stephen, “and disposed to exert himself to learn some history.…
We are six in this little house, a sort of adjunct to the
big one in whose grounds it stands, and we lead a quiet and
happy reading-party sort of life with all the ordinary rustic
pursuits.” The other four members of the party were Mr.
Dalton, “a lively little Frenchman,” “a young aristocrat, whose
father is the Earl of Strathmore, and a naval lieutenant, kept
on shore by a bad knee, both of whom are very pleasant, and
have more brains than they take credit for.”</p>

<p>In October 1883 the King accompanied Prince Albert
Victor to Cambridge, and saw him matriculated as an undergraduate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
member of Trinity College, that ancient and splendid
foundation to which he himself belonged. Two sets of rooms,
one for the Prince and one for Mr. Dalton, were prepared on
the top floor of a staircase in Nevile’s Court, the quietest court
in Trinity.</p>

<p>It was at Cambridge that certain sterling qualities possessed
by Prince Albert Victor first became manifest to any considerable
circle, and through them to the public at large. His life
at the University was simple and well ordered. He had not&mdash;nor
was it desirable that he should have&mdash;the specialised intellect
which wins University prizes and scholarships, but he displayed
in a marked degree that peculiarly Royal quality of recognising
intellect in others. Of those whom he admitted to his friendship
while at Cambridge nearly all have become, or are becoming,
distinguished in various walks of life. He was not distinguished
from his undergraduate contemporaries except by
the silk gown of the fellow-commoner&mdash;the Prince never wore
the gold tassel to which he was entitled&mdash;and by immunity from
University examinations.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the Prince was idle
at the University. On the contrary, he read for six or seven
hours a day regularly&mdash;a good deal more than the average
undergraduate can be persuaded to do; and he was in another
respect intellectually ahead of most of his contemporaries,
namely, in his familiar knowledge of modern languages. He
had read German at Heidelberg with Professor Ihne, and he
kept it up while at Cambridge with a German tutor. He spoke
French easily and well, and he had also a literary knowledge of
that language, having spent some time in Switzerland with a
French tutor. His college tutor was Mr. Joseph Prior. Mr.
Stephen exercised a general supervision over his reading, and
he attended the late Professor Seeley’s History Lectures and
Mr. Gosse’s Lectures on English Literature.</p>

<p>Prince Albert Victor strongly resembled his father in many
respects, notably in his habits of order and method, and in his
complete freedom from affectation or assumption. He was,
indeed, if anything, almost too modest and retiring, but those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
who knew him bore witness to his real geniality and thoughtful
consideration for others. At Cambridge he attended his
College chapel twice on Sundays, and once or twice during the
week. He generally dined in the College hall, when he would
be assigned a place at the Fellows’ table. He was fond, however,
of giving little dinner-parties of six or eight in his own
rooms in College, usually on Thursdays, his guests on these
occasions often including some of the senior members of the
University.</p>

<p>After dinner, the Royal host would generally arrange a
rubber or two of whist. He did not play cricket or football,
but was fond of polo and hockey, and he occasionally hunted.
He might often have been met in the neighbourhood of
Cambridge riding in the company of a few of his undergraduate
friends, to whom he liked to offer a mount, especially in cases
where he knew it was needed. The Prince had an inherited
love of music, and he attended pretty regularly some weekly
concerts of chamber music given at the Cambridge Town Hall.
He was also a member of the Cambridge A.D.C., and patronised
its performances, and he occasionally attended the debates at the
Union, though he did not speak himself. He joined the University
Volunteer Corps, and was photographed in his uniform.</p>

<p>One traditionally Royal quality the Prince possessed in an
extraordinary degree, namely, a perfectly marvellous memory
for names and faces. Indeed, his memory in general was
singularly tenacious, and in his historical studies he exhibited
a wonderful power of quickly mastering the most intricate
genealogical tables.</p>

<p>The Prince went for the Long Vacation on a reading party
to Heidelberg, and while there he received an amusing poem
from Mr. H. F. Wilson, one of his Cambridge friends, which
is printed in Mr. Vincent’s memoir. The following may be
quoted as perhaps the most characteristic lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">The tail of Mr. J. N. Dalton.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Prince came of age in 1885, and the house-party at
Sandringham given to celebrate the occasion was one of the
largest gatherings ever held there. The company included a
considerable number of Prince Albert Victor’s Cambridge
friends.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of Prince Albert Victor’s residence at
Cambridge, the honorary degree of LL.D. was conferred upon
him, and then his father decided that it was time for him to
enter the army. He was gazetted a lieutenant in the 10th
Hussars, of which the King is now colonel-in-chief, and while
he was quartered at Aldershot the father and son saw a great
deal of each other. In the army, as in the navy, Prince Albert
Victor was treated as far as possible exactly like his brother
officers; and indeed it is highly probable that, had he been
offered any exceptional privileges, he would have steadily
refused to take advantage of them. The Prince became a
captain in the 9th Lancers and in the 3rd King’s Royal Rifles
and aide-de-camp to the Queen in 1887, and two years later
attained the rank of major, returning to his old regiment, the
10th Hussars.</p>

<p>Prince Albert Victor’s training as a soldier was real and
thorough. He was not spared the drudgery of drill and the
riding school through which the ordinary subaltern has to pass,
and yet at the same time his work was frequently interrupted
by the duty of attending various ceremonial functions. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
life was but sparingly varied with days with the hounds and
shooting, to which the Prince eagerly looked forward. It is
generally agreed by his contemporaries that he became an
excellent officer, and his private letters to his friends prove how
absorbed he was in his military career.</p>

<p>King Edward had retained such pleasant recollections of
his own visit to India, that he determined that his elder son
should at an early date make a tour in the great Eastern
dependency. The tour was arranged, and proved extremely
successful from every point of view, the Prince particularly
enjoying the excellent and varied sport shown him by his keen
Indian hosts. His Royal Highness was gazetted honorary
colonel of the 4th Bengal Infantry, the 1st Punjab Cavalry
(Prince Albert Victor’s Own), and the 4th Bombay Cavalry.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from India, Prince Albert Victor was
created Duke of Clarence and Avondale, and Earl of Athlone,
in the peerage of the United Kingdom. He was formally
introduced to the House of Lords by his father on 23rd January
1890, the ceremony being watched by Queen Alexandra from
a gallery. This was an event unique in English history. The
Duke of Clarence was the only eldest son of a Prince of Wales
who attained his majority, to say nothing of taking his seat in
the House of Lords, while his father was still Heir-Apparent
to the Crown.</p>

<p>During the year which followed, the King gave up regularly
a certain portion of his time to initiating his elder son in all the
varied, if monotonous, duties which were likely to fall to his
lot, a task which was really in no wise irksome, for those who
knew the Duke of Clarence best were well aware that his father
had ever been his best friend, and that he himself was never so
happy as when he was allowed to share in any sense his father’s
life and interests.</p>

<p>After the death of the Duke of Clarence, the King and his
family naturally retired into the deepest privacy, and it was
many months before His Majesty had sufficiently recovered
from the blow to be able to take up again the thread of his
public duties.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES&mdash;MARRIAGE OF PRINCE
GEORGE&mdash;THE DIAMOND JUBILEE&mdash;DEATH OF THE DUCHESS
OF TECK</span></h2>

<p>The year 1893 brought to the King a very fortunate distraction,
which prevented his mind from dwelling too much on
his still recent bereavement in a way that could not have been
accomplished by the customary round of ceremonial visits and
functions. This distraction was his appointment as a member
of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor. The
King was genuinely delighted with this opportunity. He
threw himself with the greatest zeal into the work, and not
only attended all the sittings, which took place in one of the
House of Lords’ Committee Rooms, but visited, <i>incognito</i>, some
of the very poorest quarters of London. It is well known that
he was exceedingly anxious to serve on the Labour Commission,
but Ministers have always been unwilling that the
Heir-Apparent should take an active part in matters connected,
even indirectly, with politics, and he has had, therefore, constantly
to play the part of the Sovereign’s deputy without the
responsibilities and interests naturally attaching to the position.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that there are few men now
living who possess better general qualifications for the difficult
work of serving on Royal Commissions than the King. He
is familiar with an almost bewildering variety of subjects, and
possesses a wonderful faculty for almost instinctively grasping
the important features and the really essential points of any
matter under discussion. He is a model chairman of a committee,
and, though he cannot ever display the slightest trace
of personal or party feeling, it is well known that he follows
with intense interest all the political and social movements of
the day, and it is no secret that he is thoroughly an Imperialist.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph by Gunn and Stuart</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>The King’s work on the Housing of the Poor Commission
was particularly congenial to him, for he has always shown an
unaffected interest in the working classes. He has long been
an annual subscriber to the Working Men’s Club and Institute
Union, and is a generous donor to the Working Men’s College.
Still more recently, in his reply to the loyal address of condolence
presented to him by the London County Council on the
death of Queen Victoria, His Majesty made a significant
allusion to his interest in the problem of the housing of the
working classes. In 1889, some years before the King joined
the Housing of the Poor Commission, he took the trouble to
go to Lambeth on business seemingly of nothing but local
interest&mdash;namely, to receive a deputation of working men on
the subject of providing a park for the district. His host was
the late Primate, Dr. Benson, who thus describes the scene
in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Went up to receive Prince of Wales and twelve Representative
Working Men at Lambeth. The latter to read him
an address on the purchase of ‘The Lawn,’ South Lambeth,
for a Public Park, and its great importance to them and their
children. Their chairman read a natural, honest speech; nothing
could be better than the tone and line of the Prince’s answer.
They were delighted by his strong shake of the hand. ‘Not
the tips of his fingers,’ they said; ‘working men have feelings,
and they would not like that.’ And, ‘It isn’t everybody that
education refines as it has him,’ said a blacksmith. ‘When
he’s king I shall be able to say that I’ve shook hands with
the Crown,’ said an engine-driver. Octavia Hill, and James
Knowles, and my wife were the only people admitted besides
his Equerry, and Donaldson, and Phillips. It will do good, and
he spoke so well.”</p>

<p>This incident is only mentioned as one out of many that
could be cited in proof, if proof were needed, of His Majest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>y’s
keen interest in everything that concerns the welfare of the
working classes. On another occasion the King was accidentally
informed that an exhibition, promoted by the working men in
South London, was somewhat languishing for lack of sufficient
notice, and unofficially His Majesty arranged to visit the
exhibition. He went through it carefully, buying and paying
for such articles as took his fancy, and the moment the fact
became known, the promoters had no reason to complain of
neglect on the part of the general public, who were eager to
see what had interested so good a judge of exhibitions as King
Edward.</p>

<p>Throughout the year 1893 the King was busily employed
in other ways also. In March he paid a formal visit to the
Public Record Office to inspect some of the priceless national
manuscripts deposited there, and in May he had the satisfaction
of seeing that great enterprise which he had himself originated,
the Imperial Institute, inaugurated in State by his Royal
Mother. It was at the Institute that Mr. Gladstone was hissed
by some unmannerly persons, to the great annoyance of the
King, who never concealed the strong respect and esteem in
which he held both Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone.</p>

<p>It is interesting also to record that in March of this year the
Queen, who was accompanied by her son, was received by the
Pope in private audience. The interview lasted about an hour.</p>

<p>The official announcement was made, appropriately enough
in May, of the betrothal of the King’s son, then Duke of York,
to Princess May of Teck. It is recorded in the late Duchess
of Teck’s <i>Life</i> that Prince George proposed to Princess May
on 3rd May 1893, at Sheen Lodge, which for some time had
been occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Fife. Both the
bride and her mother agreed that the trousseau should be
entirely of home workmanship. “I am determined,” said the
Duchess of Teck, “that all the silk shall come from England,
all the flannel from Wales, all the tweeds from Scotland, and
every yard of lace and poplin from Ireland.” The wedding
gown was woven at Spitalfields, and was of silver and white
brocade, the design being of roses, shamrock, and thistles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
The bridal veil&mdash;the same which had been worn by the bride’s
mother on her wedding day in 1866&mdash;was of the finest Honiton
lace, designed in a sequence of cornucopiæ filled with roses,
thistles, and shamrock.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The time of the short engagement was filled with preparations
of all kinds, and from a letter written by Mrs. Dalrymple,
and quoted in the Duchess of Teck’s <i>Life</i>, we obtain a good
idea of how the days passed by at White Lodge:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I remember the happy afternoon I spent at White Lodge
a few days before the marriage. We were a large and merry
party, including the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
and some time was spent in looking at the numerous presents.
Tea was served on the lawn under the copper beech, and the
dear Princess sat at the head of the table making tea for all;
on one side of her was a pile of telegrams received, while on
the other, scattered about amongst the cups, were packets of
telegraph forms. Messages were constantly being delivered,
and the Princess and the Duke as quickly wrote out the replies;
no word of complaint was uttered at these incessant interruptions.
Her Royal Highness’s amiable readiness to accede to
the many appeals for a place from which to see the bridal
procession was wonderful. Princess Mary begged me to visit
her the day after the marriage, and her eyes filled with tears as
she spoke of parting from ‘her precious child.’ Much, however,
as I wished to accept the suggestion, I did not do so, but
implored the Princess to take the rest that I knew she so
urgently needed.”</p>

<p>The qualities both of head and of heart possessed by
Prince George’s bride were, at any rate partially, realised by
the nation. An incident that occurred at St. Moritz in 1894
is not so well known. The Duchess of Teck and her daughter
were on a visit there when a fire broke out which entirely
destroyed several shops and houses, and threatened destruction
to the lower village. Both the Princess and her mother took
active steps to rescue the goods from burning, carrying out the
things in their arms. They were the first to go among the
sufferers by the fire offering words of consolation, and started
a subscription in their aid.</p>

<p>After a very short engagement, the marriage took place
in the Chapel-Royal, St. James’s, on 6th July, in the presence
of all the Royal family, as well as the present Emperor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Russia and the King and Queen of Denmark. King Edward
naturally took a prominent part in supervising all the arrangements,
and was much gratified by the outburst of popular
enthusiasm which greeted his son’s union with the daughter
of the universally-beloved Duchess of Teck.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how frequently, ever since the
marriage, the King has associated his heir with himself in the
performance of his public duties, while the constant companionship
of father and son is a striking testimony to their complete
sympathy with one another.</p>

<p>The following year was notable for two Royal marriages
in the King’s immediate circle, and for a bereavement which
touched both His Majesty and the Queen in their closest
family affections. The King went to Coburg in April to be
present at the wedding of his niece, Princess Victoria Melita
of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and his nephew, the Grand Duke
of Hesse, the only son of the lamented Princess Alice. The
occasion brought together a remarkable number of prominent
members of Royal Houses, including Queen Victoria and the
German Emperor, and was rendered additionally memorable
by the fact that the engagement of the present Tsar of Russia
to the bridegroom’s sister was then publicly announced.</p>

<p>The King, who was on this occasion accompanied by Queen
Alexandra, went to St. Petersburg in August for the wedding
of the Grand Duchess Xenia, which was celebrated with all
the lavish magnificence of Russian Court ceremonies.</p>

<p>Although the Tsar was not then in his usual robust health,
there was nothing to indicate how soon the King and Queen
were to be recalled to Russia on a far different mission. To
their lasting sorrow, the summons to the Tsar’s death-bed at
Livadia arrived too late for them to be present at the last.
Their Majesties left London on 31st October, immediately on
receipt of an urgent message from the Tsaritsa, and had proceeded
as far as Vienna when the news was broken to them
that all was over. They, however, continued their melancholy
journey, which was much delayed by bad weather, in order
that they might be with the widowed Empress and her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
through the terrible strain of the return to St. Petersburg, and
the ordeal of the funeral ceremonies.</p>

<p>The King’s fifty-third birthday was spent at Livadia, and
for the first time since his birth the anniversary celebrations in
London and at Sandringham did not take place.</p>

<p>When the funeral <i>cortège</i> reached St. Petersburg, Prince
George joined his parents, and together they attended the
elaborate obsequies of the Emperor, and the very quiet
wedding of the young Tsar and Princess Alix of Hesse, which
followed a few days later. The King remained in Russia for
the Queen’s birthday, and left with his son the following day,
while Her Majesty stayed behind to support her sister, the
Empress Alexander.</p>

<p>The relations between England and Russia after the King’s
return became noticeably more cordial, and there is no doubt
that this was owing in a large measure to His Majesty’s
personal exertions, and the sympathy which he and his son
displayed with the Russian people in their great sorrow.</p>

<p>During this year of 1894 the King exhibited his usual
complaisance in attending various local ceremonies. Among
these may be mentioned the opening of the Tower Bridge by
the King and Queen, on behalf of Queen Victoria, in June;
while in July their Majesties attended the Welsh Eisteddfod
at Carnarvon, where they were received with great enthusiasm.
A special session was held, at which the King was initiated as
“Iorweth Dywysog” (Edward the Prince), Queen Alexandra
as “Hoffder Prydain” (Britain’s Delight), and the Princess
Victoria as “Buddug” (the modern Welsh form of Boadicea).</p>

<p>The King was always willing to emphasise his connection
with the Principality from which he then took his title, and
when the long-desired University of Wales became an accomplished
fact, he readily consented to be its first Chancellor.
His Majesty was installed in this office at Aberystwyth in June
1896, and his first act as Chancellor was to confer an honorary
degree on Queen Alexandra. At the luncheon which followed,
the King’s health was proposed by Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p>In the following month, the marriage of Princess Maud to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Prince Charles of Denmark took place in the chapel of Buckingham
Palace in the presence of Queen Victoria and the
Royal families of the two countries.</p>

<p>Archbishop Benson officiated at the wedding, and he gives
the following charming description of the ceremony in his
diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Married the Princess Maud to Prince Charles of Denmark.
The brightest of the Princesses, and almost as young as when
I confirmed her. He is a tall, gallant-looking sailor. Hope he
will make her happy. The Chapel and old conservatory ineffectually
disguised by church furniture&mdash;all well arranged, and
the banquet also. The whole very royally done. The group
of great peers of the Queen’s Household afterwards was
striking, as were the greater peers also in Chapel, and Mr.
Gladstone decidedly ageing and paling, though they say he
is well. The Queen was the wonderful sight&mdash;so vigorous.
In the Bow Room afterwards, where fifty Royalties signed the
book, she called me to her, and I knelt and kissed her hand,
and she talked very spiritedly a few minutes. As soon as it
was over an Indian servant wheeled in her chair to take her
out; she instantly waved it back. ‘Behind the door,’ she
said, and walked all across the room with her stick most
gallantly.”</p>

<p>The month of May was naturally a very busy one for the
King and Queen. On the 22nd their Majesties, representing
Queen Victoria, opened the new Blackwall tunnel in State,
the East End of London giving them a right Royal reception.
On this occasion His Majesty was presented with one of the
heaviest gold medals ever struck in England, weighing 12
ounces, and bearing on the reverse a representation of the
tunnel in perspective. On the 26th His Majesty opened the
new Medical School of Guy’s Hospital; on the 27th the King
and Queen, with their son and two of their daughters, opened
the Royal Military Tournament; on the 28th, at the request of
Queen Victoria, the King and Queen, accompanied by Princess
Victoria, laid the first stone of the Royal London Ophthalmic
Hospital in the City Road; on the 29th the King and Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with their son and two of their daughters, went down to Canterbury
to open the restored Chapter-house of the Cathedral, and
in the evening the King dined with the past and present
officers of the Norfolk Artillery Militia, of which he is honorary
colonel. On the 31st the King held a <i>levée</i> at St. James’s
Palace, and in the evening dined with the 1st Guards Club.</p>

</div>

<p>This is a short summary, which does not pretend to be by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
any means exhaustive of His Majesty’s engagements for a
very few days, but it brings out perhaps more vividly than a
detailed list could possibly do the whole-hearted manner in
which the King threw himself into the great tide of national
rejoicing which reached its flood in that memorable June of
1897.</p>

<p>King Edward, for a variety of reasons, took a much greater
part in the Diamond Jubilee festivities of 1897 than he did in
those of ten years before. All the arrangements were submitted
for his approval as well as Queen Victoria’s, and it was
largely owing to his conspicuous organising ability that everything
went off with such triumphant success. Both the King
and Queen Alexandra associated themselves in a special manner
with the occasion, the former by his Hospital Fund for London,
and the latter by her thoughtful scheme of providing one good
dinner for the very poorest. The Hospital Fund greatly
benefited by the sale of a special stamp, the design of which
was selected by the King himself.</p>

<p>King Edward, who had been made an honorary Admiral of
the Fleet at the Golden Jubilee of 1887, represented his
mother at the magnificent naval review at Spithead, which
was generally agreed to be, in its way, the finest spectacle
of all that the Jubilee festivities afforded. Many foreign
warships were sent by other countries as tokens of international
courtesy. Towards the officers of these vessels the
King displayed all his wonted cordiality; and in the arrangements
for their entertainment his efforts were heartily seconded
by Viscount Goschen, then First Lord of the Admiralty, and
the other naval authorities. The spectacle of so vast a
concourse of British vessels was rendered doubly impressive
by the knowledge that it had been assembled without weakening
in the slightest degree the squadrons on the numerous
British naval stations all over the world. There was much
point in the remark said to have been made by the United
States Special Ambassador to the First Lord: “I guess, sir,
this makes for peace!”</p>

<p>On the eventful morning of the 22nd June, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Jubilee honours were announced, it was found that Queen
Victoria, while conferring some mark of her favour on each
of her sons, had created a new and special dignity for the
Heir-Apparent. The announcement was made in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Queen has been graciously pleased, on the occasion
of Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee, to appoint Field-Marshal
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, K.G., G.C.B., to be
Great Master and Principal Knight Grand Cross of the Most
Honourable Order of the Bath.”</p>

<p>That this distinction was very gratifying to the King was
significantly shown in the following month, when he gave a
great banquet at St. James’s Palace to the Knights Grand
Cross of the Order of the Bath in celebration of his appointment.
It was an absolutely unique gathering of men who had
rendered distinguished service to the State, in statesmanship,
in diplomacy, in the profession of arms, in the navy, and in the
departments of civil administration.</p>

<p>Since his accession, His Majesty has appointed his brother,
the Duke of Connaught, to succeed him as Great Master of the
Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>By command of Queen Victoria, the King held a State
reception and investiture at St. James’s Palace on 21st July,
when he received on behalf of Her Majesty a large number
of Diamond Jubilee addresses and invested the newly-created
Companions of the Orders of the Bath, the Star of India,
St. Michael and St. George, and the Indian Empire, and on
the same day His Majesty also opened the new Tate Gallery
at Millbank.</p>

<p>It was in this month that His Majesty was elected to the
fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of London at
a comitia of the College&mdash;an honour which he valued highly.
As a non-medical fellow the King had had only three predecessors,
the Marquis of Dorchester in 1658, the Duke of
Manchester in 1717, and the Duke of Richmond in 1729.
The Royal diploma was, it is understood, specially composed
for the occasion, and did not give the new fellow complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
freedom to practise in his new profession! Later on, His
Majesty was destined to experience in his own person the
marvellous benefits which modern surgery has placed at the
service of suffering humanity.</p>

</div>

<p>The rest of the Diamond Jubilee year was spent in comparative
quietude by the King and Queen Alexandra, although
His Majesty took an active part in the exceptionally brilliant
season. He attended, among other great functions, the Fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Dress Ball given by the Duchess of Devonshire, wearing on
this occasion the splendid costume of the Grand Master of the
Knights-Hospitallers of Malta.</p>

<p>King Edward and Queen Alexandra left Marlborough
House on 10th August for Bayreuth, and His Majesty
arrived at Marienbad on the 18th, travelling <i>incognito</i> as
Lord Renfrew. Her Majesty went to Bernstorff to visit
her parents, and was joined there early in September by
the King. His Majesty afterwards visited the Empress
Frederick at Cronberg, and returned to Marlborough House
on 25th September, while Her Majesty prolonged her stay
in Denmark till October.</p>

<p>On 16th October the King stood as sponsor at the
christening of the infant son and heir of the Duke and
Duchess of Marlborough&mdash;an interesting occasion, for His
Majesty had been godfather to the Duke himself some twenty-five
years before.</p>

<p>This summer was also rendered memorable for the visit
paid by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York to
Ireland. Their Royal Highnesses spent a fortnight there,
stopping with the Lord-Lieutenant, Earl Cadogan, in Dublin;
afterwards visiting some of the great houses of the Irish
nobility, and seeing a great deal of the lovely scenery for
which Ireland is famous, including Killarney, from which the
Duke takes the title of Baron.</p>

<p>In Dublin the Duke of Cornwall and York and the ever-popular
Lord Roberts were installed with great pomp and
ceremony as Knights of the Order of St. Patrick. The Duke
wore the same sword which his father had used when he was
installed some three-and-twenty years before.</p>

</div>

<p>His Royal Highness on the termination of the visit wrote
the following letter to Lord Cadogan, the Lord-Lieutenant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mount Stewart, Newtownards, Co. Down</span>,<br />
<i>8th September 1897</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lord Cadogan</span>&mdash;I cannot leave Ireland without
expressing to you, on behalf of the Duchess of York and
myself, our very sincere appreciation of the warm and enthusiastic
welcome which has been accorded to us during our visit
by all classes and in all parts of the country.</p>

<p>“Nothing could have exceeded the kindness and hospitality
which have been shown to us, and the agreeable impressions
which we have derived from our visit can never be effaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from our memory. I regret that the limited time at our
disposal rendered it impossible for us to see many districts
in a country which contains so much that is beautiful and
interesting. I hope, however, that we may have further
opportunities of improving our acquaintance with the people
of Ireland and with the country of which they are so justly
proud.&mdash;Believe me, very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">George</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Their Royal Highnesses came home by way of Scotland,
visiting Glasgow, where they performed several ceremonial
functions, and staying with Lord Rosebery at Dalmeny for
two nights. They then went to Ness Castle and on to
Guisachan for fishing and deer-stalking as the guests of Lord
and Lady Tweedmouth, and ultimately visited Queen Victoria
at Balmoral.</p>

<p>This Royal visit to Ireland exhibited in a striking manner
the extent to which party passions had been allayed in the distressful
country. The Duke and Duchess had everywhere a
respectful and frequently an enthusiastic reception; and in
almost every address received by their Royal Highnesses the
desirability of establishing a Royal residence in Ireland was
pointedly referred to. The profound effect of the visit was
seen a month or two later, when, on the death of the lamented
Duchess of Teck, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of
Dublin telegraphed their condolences, both officially and
privately, not to the Duke of Teck, as might have been expected,
but to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York.
On this mournful occasion, also, the Corporation of “rebel”
Cork passed a resolution of sympathy.</p>

</div>

<p>The death of the Duchess of Teck on 27th October was a
terrible blow to the King and Queen Alexandra. In the
previous April the Duchess had undergone a severe operation
with the magnificent courage characteristic of her, and
as soon as she was able to receive visitors the very first who
came was King Edward. Her Royal Highness seemed quite
to have conquered her malady. She went up to London from
White Lodge in June, and bore her part in many of the
Diamond Jubilee rejoicings. No one who saw the Jubilee
procession will ever forget the people’s welcome to the
Duchess of Teck&mdash;great in the West End, but greatest of all
in the poorer parts of London, and second only to the reception
accorded to Queen Victoria herself. The Duchess attended
the Garden Party at Buckingham Palace, and at the Duchess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of Devonshire’s ball she appeared as the Electress Sophia.
Visits to Northumberland and Westmoreland followed, but
towards the end of October, when Her Royal Highness had
returned to White Lodge, the illness returned. The surgeons
again operated successfully, but the patient could not rally from
the shock.</p>

<p>There had been practically no warning, so that the news
came with equal suddenness both to the Royal Family and
the nation. King Edward and Queen Alexandra immediately
hurried up from Sandringham, and afterwards, at the
deeply impressive funeral in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor,
His Majesty represented his Royal mother.</p>

<p>This bereavement was the more terrible from its utter
unexpectedness, and, as has been so singularly often the case
in our Royal Family, it happened in the autumn. Princess
Mary, who stood in the relation of second cousin to King
Edward, was, although belonging technically to the same
generation as Queen Victoria, but a few years older than His
Majesty, and the most affectionate and close relations had
always existed between them, a fact shown on many occasions
throughout their joint lives, and nowhere more strikingly than
in the great satisfaction expressed by both the King and
Queen Alexandra at the marriage of their only surviving son to
the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck.</p>

<p>Earlier in the autumn an attempt was made to use the
King’s great personal prestige and popularity in order to
bring to a close the struggle between masters and men in the
engineering trade. The writer received the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Marlborough House, Pall Mall, S.W.</span>,<br />
<i>8th October 1897</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I am directed by the Prince of Wales to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., and to
inform you, in reply, that, while he deeply deplores the disastrous
state of affairs in the engineering industry, he feels that
it would not be right or proper for him to attempt in any way
to interfere or to mix himself up in them. His Royal Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
regrets that he is unable to act on your suggestion.&mdash;I am,
Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Francis Knollys</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Towards the end of November the King visited Durham,
and in his reply to the inevitable address gave some interesting
reminiscences of the late Bishop of the diocese. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dr. Lightfoot, who was transferred from his theological
studies in the University of Cambridge to undertake
the administration of a large and important diocese, evinced
a powerful personality of character through the brilliancy of
his intellect, his profound learning, his earnest piety, and a
capacity for organisation so remarkable as almost to appear
intuitive.… I may mention that I myself was personally
acquainted with Bishop Lightfoot when I was an undergraduate
at Cambridge, and I wish to add my own testimony
to the admiration and regard with which he inspired all who,
like myself, had the advantage of knowing him.”</p>

<p>On 21st December Queen Alexandra received a grateful
address from the chairmen of the sixty local committees who
were entrusted with the management of Her Majesty’s
Diamond Jubilee dinner fund for the poor of London, and
so ended this eventful year.</p>

<span class="smaller">LATER YEARS&mdash;A SERIOUS ACCIDENT TO THE KING&mdash;GRADUAL
RECOVERY&mdash;THE ATTEMPT ON THE KING’S LIFE</span></h2>

<p>The year 1898, destined to bring His Majesty a serious
accident and a tedious convalescence, opened uneventfully.
On New Year’s Day the King accepted the post of Patron of
the Fourth International Congress of Zoology, which had
arranged to meet at Cambridge in August. In January, too,
the Brixton branch of the Social Democratic Federation sent
to the King a proposal that the Government should organise
a system of State maintenance of the underfed London school
children. In reply, Sir F. Knollys wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His Royal Highness directs me to assure you that he
feels the greatest sympathy for the large number of underfed
and half-starved children living in London, and although he
is afraid he does not feel himself at liberty to support your
particular proposal, it will give him much pleasure to send a
donation to the London Schools Dinner Association, which he
understands is doing very good work in the required direction.”</p>

<p>In March the King went to Cannes, and saw President
Faure in Paris on his way thither. On 10th March His
Majesty laid the first stone of a new jetty at Cannes in the
midst of a brilliant assemblage. He said, speaking to the
Mayor:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>“You know what pleasure it gives me to spend a few weeks
in your beautiful country, where I always meet with a hospitable
reception.… In laying the first stone of the new
jetty, in accordance with your kind wish, I desire to tell you
especially how touched I was at your having thought of giving
it my name. I trust that the very wise and unanimous impulse
given by you to yachting at Cannes will not fail of its effect.
You can safely rely upon my support, for I am sincerely glad
to see this friendly competition between our two countries
developed, and, as you have so well said, I hope with you that
this ceremony may be a fresh pledge of cordial relations
between France and Great Britain.”</p>

<p>To M. Leroux, Prefect of the Alpes Maritimes, His Majesty
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am touched by the sentiments which, in the name of
the Government of the Republic, you have just expressed. I
sincerely hope that France may long enjoy the benefits of the
Government which you represent, and that the cordial relations
between France and Great Britain may continue for the good
of humanity. I am, indeed, happy to be able to lend my
co-operation to this hospitable country, for which I wish the
greatest prosperity.”</p>

<p>On 25th April His Majesty opened the Royal Photographic
Society’s International Exhibition at the Crystal Palace. The
Society was founded in 1853 under the auspices of Queen
Victoria and the Prince Consort. The King naturally took
special interest in the exhibit of his Hospital Fund for London,
which included photographs of the “Roll of Ministering
Children.” This roll comprised so many portraits of the
King’s descendants that His Majesty drily observed that he
seemed to be surrounded by grandchildren.</p>

<p>This spring His Majesty was much occupied with the
preparations for the Paris Exhibition of 1900. He was Chairman
of both the executive and the finance committee of the
Royal Commission which was appointed to see that Great
Britain was adequately represented.</p>

<p>On 18th May the King reviewed the Lancashire Hussars
at Birkdale, it being the jubilee of this yeomanry regiment, and
also visited Southport and Wigan. On 20th May he reviewed
the Royal Bucks Hussars in Howe Park.</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Gladstone caused much sorrow both to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
His Majesty and to Queen Alexandra, who had frequently
demonstrated the regard in which they held the veteran statesman
and his devoted wife. At the funeral of Mr. Gladstone
in the Abbey on 28th May 1898 the King was the chief
pall-bearer with his son, the Duke of Cornwall and York, and
at the close of the service, with the other pall-bearers, they
kissed the hand of Mrs. Gladstone. Queen Alexandra and
the Duchess of Cornwall and York were present at the service.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards their Majesties lost another old friend,
and curiously enough a devoted follower of Mr. Gladstone,
namely, the first Lord Playfair, so long known as Sir Lyon
Playfair, who had taught the King science in His Majesty’s
student days at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>On 31st May the <i>London Gazette</i> published the following,
which was naturally of much interest to the King:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Queen has been pleased, by Letters Patent under
the Great Seal, to declare that the children of the eldest son of
any Prince of Wales shall have, and at all times hold and enjoy,
the style, title, and attribute of ‘Royal Highness.’”</p>

<p>On 8th June Queen Alexandra presented prizes in the
Albert Hall to the boys of the Royal Masonic Institution at
Woodgreen. His Majesty, in acknowledging a vote of thanks
to her, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Though the Princess has set a good example, as the wife
of a Freemason, in not attempting to discover the secrets of
our craft, I think she has taken a philanthropic interest in all
that concerns our works.”</p>

<p>Three days later the King opened the Reading University
Extension Hospital and inspected the Royal Berkshire Hospital,
afterwards going on a visit to his old friends Lord and
Lady Wantage at Lockinge. On 18th June the King distributed
the prizes at Wellington College, and on 21st June,
accompanied by the Queen, he laid the foundation stone of
the new buildings of the North London or University College
Hospital.</p>

<p>A week later the King paid a visit to Lord and Lady
Warwick, and much enjoyed driving in motor cars, then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
comparatively novel form of conveyance. During the visit
Lady Warwick drove the King to Barford to call upon
Mr. Joseph Arch, M.P., in his cottage. His Majesty had a
high opinion of Mr. Arch, who had risen by his own exertions
from a very humble origin, and at that time represented the
electoral division of Norfolk in which Sandringham is situated.</p>

<p>On 7th July the King, with the Duke of Sparta, who was
on a visit to this country, attended the presentation of colours
by Queen Victoria to the 3rd Coldstream Guards at Aldershot.</p>

<p>The King met with a serious accident on 18th July while
at Waddesdon Manor, Bucks, on a visit to Baron Ferdinand de
Rothschild. His Majesty slipped in descending a staircase
and sustained a fracture of the knee-cap, but was able to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to Marlborough House the same afternoon. Not much progress
was made, however, and on the 19th Sir William MacCormac
and Sir Francis Laking decided to call in the famous surgeon,
Sir Thomas Smith, who had undoubtedly prolonged the Duchess
of Teck’s life. It is interesting to note that the Röntgen rays
were employed to ascertain the extent of the injury, probably
the first occasion of their being used for a Royal patient. Rest
was compulsory, and though it must have been irksome in the
extreme to one of the King’s active habits, yet nothing could
exceed the cheerfulness displayed by the patient.</p>

<p>On the 21st Lord Lister, the “father” of antiseptic surgery,
was called in, and with characteristic consideration, in
view of the anxiety exhibited by the whole Empire, the King
authorised the publication of a detailed statement regarding
the accident.</p>

<p>From this it appeared that he missed his footing while
coming down the spiral staircase at Waddesdon Manor, and in
the sudden severe effort made to save himself from falling
sustained a fracture of the left patella. “About one-fifth of
the bone, somewhat crescentic in shape, was torn away, along
with the tendinous insertion of the quadriceps extensor, and
the gap between the fragments amounted to a little more than
two inches.” Sir W. MacCormac and Sir Francis Laking
concluded their statement by the remark that the illustrious
patient “is bearing the enforced restraint with exemplary
patience and good temper.” Of course what every one feared
was some permanent lameness or weakness of the limb, but
this, as will be seen from what follows, was fortunately averted.</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra was unremitting in her attentions to the
invalid, and was with difficulty prevailed upon to leave his room
for necessary air and exercise. On the 23rd Mr. Alfred Fripp,
Surgeon-in-ordinary, who was away on his honeymoon at the
time the accident occurred, joined the other medical attendants,
who in consultation decided that the patient might attend the
Cowes Regatta on board the Royal yacht <i>Osborne</i>. It was
hoped that the change of scene would facilitate recovery, and
the decision was also naturally gratifying to Queen Victoria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
who was then in residence at Osborne, and wished to be near
her son.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 24th, the patient was connected by electrophone
with St. Michael’s, Chester Square, and heard his
honorary chaplain, Canon Fleming, refer to the accident and
the national anxiety it had caused. In the evening the invalid
heard a sacred concert, also through the electrophone.</p>

<p>The Sultan was greatly concerned at the news of the
accident, and even offered to send the well-known Turkish
surgeon, Djemal Pasha, to attend on the patient.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the King’s kindly consideration that
before leaving London for Cowes he sent a gold scarf-pin, set
with emeralds, and a letter of thanks to Dr. Shaw, the local
practitioner who had attended him at Waddesdon immediately
after the accident.</p>

<p>On 30th July the King, accompanied by the Queen,
Princess Victoria, and Prince Nicholas and Princess Marie of
Greece, left London for Cowes. Sir F. Laking and Mr. Fripp
were in medical attendance, and the transport to Paddington,
and thence by the Queen’s train to Portsmouth Jetty, was
accomplished with complete comfort and safety. The patient
was carried by bluejackets in his invalid’s chair on board the
<i>Osborne</i>, and it is needless to say that the “handy men” did
their work to perfection, with masculine strength allied to
womanly tenderness. On the 31st Queen Victoria visited the
patient and found him in excellent spirits and making good
progress.</p>

<p>The Queen of Denmark fell seriously ill at this time, and
as King Edward was going on so well, Queen Alexandra left
on 3rd August for Copenhagen, attended by Miss Knollys
and Sir Francis Laking. Princess Victoria remained with her
father.</p>

<p>On the 6th it was announced that no further bulletins would
be issued, as the King’s progress was so satisfactory. Queen
Victoria paid him frequent visits, and on the 12th Lord
Rosebery was his guest. The <i>Osborne</i> often went for short
cruises, sometimes as far as the Needles, and the King was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
much gratified to have his son and daughter-in-law with him,
as well as his grandchildren, the little Princes Edward and
Albert.</p>

<p>At length on the 23rd the <i>Osborne</i> left for a longer cruise
in the Channel, the programme including visits to Plymouth
and Torquay. Mr. Fripp was in medical charge. This did
the patient great good, and at some of the places at which
the yacht touched he was able to obtain carriage exercise,
four of the <i>Osborne’s</i> bluejackets having been drilled as a
carrying party. His Majesty thoroughly realised that complete
recovery must not only be a matter of time, but must also
depend on strict obedience to the doctors’ orders, and, as the
event proved, he showed himself a model patient in every way.
Queen Victoria’s anxiety about her son abated, and she was
able to leave for Balmoral on 31st August. The patient
particularly enjoyed the opportunity of entertaining his
friends on board the yacht, including the Portuguese Minister
and Mr. Christopher Sykes. He paid a long visit to Mount
Edgcumbe, landing and driving in the park.</p>

<p>On 2nd September the <i>Osborne</i> returned to Cowes, and on
the following day the patient was allowed to stand up for the
first time and to walk very carefully a distance of three feet.</p>

<p>The health of the Queen of Denmark continued to give
great anxiety to His Majesty, and the Duke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York, with little Prince Edward, left England
for Copenhagen to be present at the celebration of the aged
Queen’s birthday, which seemed only too likely to be the last
that she would ever spend on earth.</p>

<p>On the 8th the King was able to visit Osborne&mdash;of course
in an invalid chair. On the 12th it was announced that a
considerable degree of mobility had been obtained in the knee
joint, and on the 14th the patient, accompanied by Princess
Victoria, left for Balmoral.</p>

<p>At this time, in spite of the tiresome restraints imposed on
him by his accident, the King did another of those graceful
little actions which have helped so much to strengthen his
hold over the affections of his subjects all over the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Some time before this His Majesty had assisted Sir James
Woodhead, then Mayor of Cape Town, to procure a mace
for the city, made of oak from the timbers of Nelson’s flagship,
the <i>Victory</i>. Unfortunately, the piece of wood sent out proved
to be so much decayed as to be practically useless. Another
application was made to the King, who again interested
himself in the kindest manner in the matter, with the result
that a fairly sound piece of wood was despatched, and the
grateful council of Cape Town passed a unanimous resolution
of thanks to their Royal benefactor. It is not a very important
incident, but it illustrates His Majesty’s willingness not only
to take trouble, but to go on taking trouble.</p>

<p>The King derived the greatest benefit from the splendid
air of Deeside, and about the middle of September Mr. Fripp,
his Surgeon-in-ordinary, was able to return to London. While
His Majesty was in Scotland Lord Crawford celebrated the
quincentenary of his earldom, and the King sent him the
following kindly telegram:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Allow me to offer you my sincerest congratulations on
the 500th anniversary of the creating of your title.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Albert
Edward.</span>”</p>

<p>On 23rd September the King left Balmoral to stay with
the Duke and Duchess of Fife at Mar Lodge, and on the 27th
the recovery of His Majesty was, so to speak, officially marked
by the announcement in the <i>London Gazette</i> that Queen
Victoria had appointed Sir William MacCormac and Sir
Francis Laking to be Knight-Commanders, and Mr. Fripp
and Fleet-Surgeon Delmege to be Members of the Royal
Victorian Order, “in recognition of their services in connection
with the recent accident met with by His Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales.”</p>

<p>All this time the condition of the venerable Queen of
Denmark had been fluctuating, now an improvement and now
a relapse being reported. At last the end came on 29th
September, and the Balmoral <i>Court Circular</i>, in recording the
mournful event, announced:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Queen’s beloved daughter-in-law, the Princess of
Wales, was in constant attendance on her mother, to whom she
was devotedly attached.”</p>

<p>The utmost sympathy was shown by all classes with King
Edward and Queen Alexandra in this terrible bereavement.
The King was represented at the funeral by his son, and the
Duke of Cambridge represented Queen Victoria. Queen
Alexandra of course remained at Copenhagen for the last sad
rites.</p>

<p>On 16th October the King returned to London, the only
trace of his accident being a very slight limp, which was
soon got rid of, and on the 28th His Majesty received Lord
Kitchener, who had come home with all the laurels of Omdurman.
On 1st November Queen Alexandra and her son
returned from Copenhagen, and their Majesties soon afterwards
paid a short visit to Sandringham. Before the end of
November the <i>Lancet</i> was able to assure the public that the
King’s recovery was complete, and His Majesty showed his
gratitude to Sir William MacCormac by his presence when, in
the following February, the eminent surgeon delivered the
Hunterian Oration at the Royal College of Surgeons of
England.</p>

<p>On 6th February 1899 another sad bereavement befell the
King in the death of Prince Alfred, the only son of his brother,
the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.</p>

<p>The King soon returned to his active public life. On 2nd
March His Majesty presided at a meeting held at Marlborough
House to establish the League of Mercy, the purpose of which
was to promote more systematic contributions to his Hospital
Fund for London. On 8th July the King reviewed some
26,000 Metropolitan Volunteers on the Horse Guards Parade.
Queen Alexandra watched the review, and her son and the
Duke of Connaught marched past at the head of the corps of
which they are honorary colonels. On 20th July the King
and Queen opened the new buildings of the Alexandra
Hospital for Children with Hip Disease in Bloomsbury, and
on the following day their Majesties entertained 1200 hospital
nurses at Marlborough House at a garden party in connection
with the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses.
On 22nd July the King, who was accompanied by his son
and daughter-in-law, was an interested spectator of the International
University Sports, when the representatives of
Oxford and Cambridge beat the champions of Harvard and
Yale by five events to four. In September His Majesty
presented new colours to the 1st Gordon Highlanders at
Ballater.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>The autumn of 1899 was signalised by the visit which was
paid to this country by the German Emperor and Empress,
who were accompanied by two of their sons, Prince Augustus
William and Prince Oscar. Their Imperial Majesties were
royally entertained at Windsor by Queen Victoria, to whom
they had come to pay their respects, a great State banquet
being the chief among the festivities. King Edward naturally
took a prominent part in the reception of the German
Emperor, who particularly enjoyed some capital shooting on his
uncle’s estate at Sandringham. At the time of His Imperial
Majesty’s visit, the British arms in South Africa were not
meeting with conspicuous success, and various political motives
were freely attributed to the Kaiser, but the mass of the
British people were content to take the event for what it
seemed to be&mdash;namely, a tribute of respect to the venerated
British Sovereign on the part of her grandson. Queen
Victoria took the opportunity to appoint the Kaiser an
honorary G.C.V.O., and to confer various grades of the same
decoration on the members of His Imperial Majesty’s suite,
which included more than one eminent German statesman.</p>

<p>The year 1900 was perhaps the most eventful in King
Edward’s life, for it saw the first attempt that had ever been
made to kill him. Queen Victoria’s memorable visit to Ireland
began on the very same day on which this dastardly attempt
was perpetrated. Her Majesty landed at Kingstown on the
morning of Wednesday, 4th April, and made her State entry
into Dublin. Meanwhile King Edward and Queen Alexandra
left England for Copenhagen. As the train by which they
were travelling to Denmark was leaving the Nord Station at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Brussels in the evening, a youth named Sipido jumped on the
footboard of the Royal carriage and fired two shots from a
revolver into the saloon. Fortunately they completely missed
the King, who behaved with the utmost coolness, and as
quickly as possible telegraphed a reassuring message to his
Royal mother.</p>

<p>Sipido, who was of course instantly arrested, declared that
he had intended “to kill the Prince because His Royal Highness
had caused thousands of men to be slaughtered in South
Africa.” There is no doubt that the youth’s mind had become
infuriated, partly by Anarchist doctrines, partly by reading
the abominable libels which for some time had been circulated
in the disreputable Continental journals regarding the conduct
of the war in South Africa. Unfortunately it has to be recorded
that not disreputable journals alone were guilty. For instance,
the issue of the <i>Kladderadatsch</i>, the German <i>Punch</i>, published
just before the attack on the King, contained a paragraph of
the grossest and most insulting character, completing a series
of abominably scurrilous attacks on His Majesty.</p>

<p>Widespread indignation was aroused, not only in the
British Empire, but also throughout the Continent, and the
King and Queen were the recipients of many thousands of
telegrams of sympathy and congratulation on His Majesty’s
happy escape. The King expressed a wish to have the bullet,
and after the trial it was sent to him. It is significant of His
Majesty’s kindly thought that he sent to M. Crocius, the
stationmaster who seized Sipido, a valuable scarf-pin as an
acknowledgment. M. Crocius also received the Royal Victorian
Order and a letter of thanks from Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>The King and Queen returned to London from Denmark
on 20th April, and their arrival was made the occasion of a
really remarkable popular demonstration. A few days later
the Press was requested to publish the following graceful
acknowledgment from His Majesty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Marlborough House, Pall Mall, S.W.</span></p>

<p>“I have been deeply touched by the numerous expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of sympathy and goodwill addressed to me on the occasion
of the providential escape of the Princess of Wales and myself
from the danger we have lately passed through.</p>

<p>“From every quarter of the globe, from the Queen’s
subjects throughout the world, as well as from the representatives
and inhabitants of foreign countries, have these
manifestations of sympathy proceeded, and on my return to
this country I received a welcome so spontaneous and hearty
that I felt I was the recipient of a most gratifying tribute of
genuine goodwill.</p>

<p>“Such proofs of kind and generous feeling are naturally
most highly prized by me, and will for ever be cherished in
my memory.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Albert Edward.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The subsequent history of Sipido throws a curious light
on Belgian notions of justice. He was placed on trial before
the Brabant Assize Court on 2nd July, and admitted his guilt,
acknowledging that the attempt was not meant as a joke.
Although the jury on the 5th brought in a verdict of “guilty,”
the Court acquitted the prisoner on the ground that he was
“irresponsible,” but ordered him to be placed at the disposal
of the Government till he attained the age of twenty-one. The
Belgian Government, however, did not prevent him from fleeing
to Paris, where he had relatives. Mr. Balfour stated in the
House of Commons that the British Government had informed
the Belgian Government that they considered the result of the
proceedings to be a grave and most unfortunate miscarriage
of justice. In excuse for not detaining Sipido, the Belgian
Government pleaded that the youth could not be arrested
during the three days’ interval to which he was entitled for
deciding whether he should lodge an appeal. But this
deceived no one, for it was not an illegal arrest which was
desired, but ordinary police surveillance.</p>

<p>Sipido did appeal against the sentence of the Assize Court,
but the Brussels Court of Cassation rejected the appeal towards
the end of September. The Belgian Government ultimately
obtained the extradition of the youth from the French Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and he arrived in Brussels in charge of the police on
27th October.</p>

<p>The death of his brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha (Duke of Edinburgh), in the summer of 1900, was a
bitter grief to the King, who was present with the German
Emperor at the funeral. The succession to the principality
had been the subject of a family arrangement on the death of
the heir, Prince Alfred, in 1899. The King himself had of
course long ago renounced his rights, and the next heir, the
Duke of Connaught, on behalf of himself and his son, Prince
Arthur, did the same, with certain reservations. The duchy
therefore passed to the young Duke of Albany, only son of the
late Prince Leopold, who was then a boy in Mr. Benson’s
house at Eton.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Day 1901 the King was much gratified
by the promotion of his son and heir to be Rear-Admiral, the
more so as the Duke had fairly earned this advancement as
judged by the ordinary standards of promotion in the Navy.
The position to which His Royal Highness was raised by the
death of his elder brother of course rendered it impossible for
him thenceforward to be so closely associated with the sea
service as, for example, his uncle, the Duke of Edinburgh, had
been, and the step in rank was no doubt conferred in anticipation
of the Duke’s approaching visit to Australia to inaugurate
the Federal Parliament. The promotion was followed, a day
or two afterwards, by the appointment of the Duke to be
Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Marine Forces.</p>

<p>Dr. Creighton, Bishop of London, died on 14th January,
and the King, who was so soon to need the deepest sympathy
himself, wrote a long and touching letter of sympathy to the
bereaved widow.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING AS A COUNTRY SQUIRE</span></h2>

<p>Sandringham is so closely associated in the public mind with
King Edward and Queen Alexandra, whose country home it
was for so many years, and is still to be from time to time, that
no apology is needed for devoting to it a special chapter.</p>

<p>When King Edward was about to set up a separate establishment,
Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort instructed
some of their most trusted friends to look out for a suitable
country estate for the Heir-Apparent. At one moment
it was proposed to buy Newstead Abbey, but its Byronic
associations caused it to be purchased as soon as it came into
the market. Eynsham, in Oxfordshire, an estate belonging
to Lord Macclesfield, also came under consideration, as well as
Elveden, in Suffolk, and Hatherop, in Gloucestershire. Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Palmerston seems to have suggested Sandringham, which at
that time belonged to his stepson, Mr. Spencer Cowper, and
accordingly the Norfolk estate was bought for £220,000.</p>

<p>The estate consisted of eight thousand acres, the nominal
rental being about £7000 a year, but everything about Sandringham
was at that time in very bad order. The house was
small and dilapidated, and the shooting and outlying portions
of the estate had been utterly neglected. It is said that the
whole rental has been expended on the property during the
last thirty-five or forty years, and a very considerable sum has
also been spent on the new house, the new gardens, the park,
and the home farms. Every kind of improvement has been
carried out, gradually but steadily, and now it may be considered
a model estate from every point of view. One of the
first institutions set up by the King was an admirable village
club, entirely built at His Majesty’s own expense. The regulations
enforced are based on what is called Dr. Arnold’s
system, and give the <i>maximum</i> of freedom to the members.</p>

<p>The old mansion, which was small and inconvenient, was
pulled down, and the present house was erected on a more
suitable site, from the designs of Mr. Humbert. The work
was not completed till 1871. The new mansion is a very
pretty gabled building, and though commodious enough, it
will not compare in point of size with many of the “stately
homes of England.” On the inner wall of the vestibule, above
the hall door, is set a tablet bearing, in Old English characters,
the inscription: “This house was built by Albert Edward,
Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, his wife, in the year of Our
Lord, 1870.”</p>

<p>The Royal host and hostess, as well as their family and
their guests, are wont to spend much of their time in the
great hall, a really beautiful apartment, with a lofty ceiling of
open oak work. Many family souvenirs are gathered here,
including a fine painting of Queen Alexandra’s birthplace,
portraits of the King and Queen of Denmark, two miniature
cannon, which were given by Napoleon III. to the King and
to his sister, the Empress Frederick, and a number of family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
portraits and photographs. Facing the main entrance is the
head of a wild bull, belonging to the famous Chillingham herd,
which was shot by the King in 1872. Underneath are Sir
Walter Scott’s lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">Spurns with black hoof and horn the sand,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And tosses high his mane of snow.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though Sandringham can boast of no wild cattle, yet the
King has been for many years a breeder of shorthorns and
Southdown sheep on a large scale, and it is difficult to estimate
the benefits which his example in this respect has conferred on
the great agricultural industry. His Majesty has always been
a very keen competitor at the various national and local shows,
and he took his duties as President of the Royal Agricultural
Society very seriously. All the Norfolk shows, from the flower
show to the poultry show, are patronised by their Majesties;
and in this, as in so many other matters, the Squire of Sandringham
sets an excellent example to those round him. The
Allotments Act was practically anticipated at Sandringham,
and the tenants of His Majesty know that he interprets very
generously any Act telling in their favour.</p>

<p>The Royal Agricultural Society held its annual meeting
in Dublin in 1871, when the King, who was accompanied
by the Duke of Connaught and Princess Louise (Duchess
of Argyll), and the Duke of Argyll, paid one of his visits to
Ireland. At the annual banquet of the Society His Majesty
spoke in terms which demonstrate in the clearest manner his
interest in agriculture and his sense of its importance in promoting
the prosperity of the nation at large. He said, in the
course of an unusually long speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The theme before me&mdash;prosperity to Ireland&mdash;is one that
might be enlarged upon greatly. No one wishes more sincerely
than I do prosperity to this country. No one in the large
assemblage which crowds this hall, and no one outside this
hall, could more largely wish for the prosperity of Ireland
which is so dear to them.… I may say that what will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
more than anything else towards making a country prosperous
is the extension of its agriculture. It was with great pleasure
that I accepted the position of President of the Royal Agricultural
Society, and it afforded me great pleasure to be present
at the Show to-day. My brother has already alluded in his
speech to the fine animals we saw, and I may add that I
feel sure that in no other part of the United Kingdom could
a more creditable Show be held than that which was opened
near Dublin this morning. During the last four years there
has been a great improvement in every respect in the shows
of the Royal Agricultural Societies.…</p>

<p>“I am assured that if the many gentlemen and landlords
who very often find some difficulty in leaving England, but
who have large interests and large estates in this country,
could contrive to come over here more frequently, it would
do more good than anything else I could imagine. I am
certain that they are anxious to come over, and that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
relations with their tenantry and those around them should
be in every respect good. I may also here refer to the great
improvement made in the erection of farm buildings and cottages.
Beyond doubt there has been progress in the direction
of improvement there; but still I believe much yet remains
to be done. Everything depends upon the well-being of the
people, and if they are properly lodged it tends to cleanliness,
and very possibly to moral advantage.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may be allowed to speak of a slight personal
experience in that matter. I have a small estate in Norfolk,
and observed myself the great importance of providing suitable
small cottages for those resident there, and, having done so,
now reap immense advantage.”</p>

<p>In the following year (19th June 1872) the King and
Queen visited King’s Lynn to see the Annual Exhibition of
the Norfolk Agricultural Society. At the entrance to the
Show His Majesty said, in reply to the usual address presented
on these occasions:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>“It has been a source of the greatest gratification to have
had it in my power to contribute in any degree to the success
of your Association, and to promote the interests of agriculture
in Norfolk. It is with these feelings that I have endeavoured
to make myself acquainted with some of the operations of
farming, and to acquire some knowledge of stock, and if I have
not always been successful in the path of competition, I have
at least obtained prizes sufficient to encourage me to persevere,
and to indulge in the hope that I shall obtain more.”</p>

<p>This hope of His Majesty’s was certainly justified, for he
not only carried off six prizes at this Norfolk show, but he has
ever since been a pretty regular prize-winner at the shows
of the Royal Agricultural Society, the Bath and West of
England, and other important exhibitions.</p>

<p>In other speeches on the same occasion at King’s Lynn
His Majesty said that during the ten years in which he had
lived in Norfolk he had endeavoured not to lag behind those
other county landlords who so ably fulfilled their duties. It
would always be his earnest endeavour to promote the welfare
of the county, in which he was much interested. He had to
thank them for the kind reception which the Princess of Wales
always experienced whenever she appeared in public. It was
most desirable that ladies should associate themselves in their
husbands’ pursuits, and when the Princess did not accompany
him he always felt that there was something wanting. His
Majesty went on to express his own great personal interest
in the Society and in the cause of agriculture generally. His
late father, the Prince Consort, always felt the greatest interest
in agriculture, and used to take his children to inspect his
prize animals.</p>

<p>The King also referred to the housing of the agricultural
labourer, and said that a landlord ought to feel a pride in
having the working classes properly housed on his estate.
Those who worked from morning to night should find on
their return a comfortable dwelling, which would promote
their moral and social well-being. He had endeavoured to
improve the cottages on his own estate, and he felt pride
and satisfaction in having his workmen properly housed.</p>

<p>Only about a fortnight later the King again demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
his interest in the county in which he had become a squire
by visiting Great Yarmouth to inspect the Norfolk Artillery
Militia. On that occasion he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This is the first occasion since my return from abroad
that I have met with an official reception, and my pleasure
is increased from the fact that I regard myself as a Norfolk
man. I have also to acknowledge the very high honour
conferred upon me last year in my having been appointed
Honorary Colonel of the Norfolk Militia Artillery.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution the
King has always been a generous friend and supporter, and
the spread of agricultural depression has naturally made his
Majesty’s support of exceptional value. The King spoke,
for example, at the fifteenth anniversary festival of the Institution,
held on 5th June 1875:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>“I sincerely say that I do take a great interest in all that
is connected with agriculture. I may call myself a colleague
of many of you present as a farmer on a small scale, and I
only hope that I may never have occasion to be a pensioner
of this institution. It is impossible, I think, for any British
gentleman to live at his country place without taking an
interest in agriculture, and in all those things which concern
the farmers of this great country. The very backbone of the
country, the best recruits of the Army and Navy, come from
the agricultural districts. We know that our commercial and
agricultural interests depend upon the valour and efficiency of
our land and sea forces.”</p>

<p>On this occasion the King added a toast which had been
most ungallantly omitted from the list&mdash;that of “The Ladies,”
and in proposing it he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We have been honoured on this occasion by fair ladies,
and I think it would be very wrong if we were to separate
without cordially drinking their health. We see especially
how much the comfort, well-being, prosperity, and happiness
of farmers and agriculturists depend upon a kind wife to
cheer them by the fireside at the end of their day’s work, and
to lighten by female influence the load of difficulties.”</p>

<p>Though naturally His Majesty will now be unable to
devote so much time to the interests of agriculture as he did
when Prince of Wales, yet he has no intention of giving up
the breeding of stock. It is understood that Her late Majesty
bequeathed to him the magnificent herds of shorthorns, Jerseys,
Devons, and Herefords established by the late Prince Consort
at Windsor on the Shaw and Flemish farms which he started
there. Prince Albert, indeed, revived the interest of the
Royal Family in agriculture, which had lapsed since the death
of “Farmer George.” Queen Victoria also had some very
good stock on the home farm at Osborne, while at Abergeldie
Mains Her Majesty kept a magnificent herd of pure-bred
Aberdeen-Angus cattle. These, without doubt, her successor
will keep up.</p>

<p>To those who study the King’s personal nature and
character, no apartment at Sandringham can be more interesting
than the library, or rather that section of the libraries, for
there are three, which is specially appropriated to His Majesty.
The fittings are those of the cabins used by the King on board
the <i>Serapis</i> during his voyage to and from India. The blotting-books
and the tables and chairs are all covered in dark blue or
green leather, and on each the Prince of Wales’s feathers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
monogram are stamped in gold. A glance at the shelves shows
what are the King’s literary tastes and preferences. He is
evidently intensely interested in the history of his own country,
especially what may be called the history of our own time.
Several shelves are entirely devoted to works dealing with the
Indian Mutiny, including the official reports, memoirs, histories,
and even novels. The King always buys every new work
connected with the public or private administration of his
Eastern Empire. Special attention has also evidently been
paid to the Crimean War, and there is a rich collection of
Colonial histories and documents. But most of the standard
works of reference are to be found in the first library, a fine
apartment, often used as a writing-room and reading-room by
visitors.</p>

<p>The second library is really the Equerries’ room. It is
there the Gentlemen of the Household are often to be found.
Here are gathered together French and English works of
reference and classics, and a splendid collection of county
histories. Novels and memoirs are not neglected, and no
week passes, when the King and Queen are in residence,
without a large consignment of British and foreign books
finding its way to Sandringham.</p>

<p>The King transacts much of the business connected with
the Sandringham estate in a pleasant morning-room. There
he receives at stated times the bailiffs and others concerned in
the management of the estate, and, as he farms himself over
1000 acres, he has much to do in the way of supervision.</p>

<p>Sandringham can boast of one of the finest private billiard-rooms
in England, and it is one of the very few country-houses
where there are bowling alleys. The King and his children
are very fond of the old-fashioned English game of bowls.</p>

<p>In 1891 the entire roofing of the main building of Sandringham
House, together with all the rooms and their contents on
the two upper floors, was destroyed by fire. The bells of the
various churches in the district clashed out the alarm. Gangs
of men and women speedily set to work to clear the principal
lower rooms of their furniture and rare, valuable, and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
contents. Queen Alexandra was staying with the Empress of
Russia, and the King was also away at the time. The amount
of damage done was about £15,000. That portion of the house
which was destroyed has been rebuilt in a thoroughly fire-proof
fashion, with iron and concrete floors and roofs; and the
opportunity was taken of making many additions to various
portions of the house, in fact about eighteen rooms were added.
It is very characteristic of the King that, by his orders, the
general works were all carried out by local tradesmen.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting departments of Sandringham
Hall is the stables, which contain a great number of carriages.
There are Russian sledges, only used in the coldest weather;
a Hungarian snow-carriage, lined with rose colour; Norwegian
carioles; a smart American buggy, painted bright yellow; a
truly beautiful gold inlaid jinricksha, sent to the King from
Japan, which is for show rather than for use; a char-à-banc,
presented by the late Duke of Sutherland; and, it need hardly
be said, every kind of ordinary two- and four-wheeled vehicle
now in general use, from the modest Norfolk cart to the stately
landau; while by the big coach is to be seen the charming
miniature four-in-hand presented by His Majesty to Queen
Alexandra just before his departure for India.</p>

<p>Both the King and Queen are passionately fond of horses,
and Her Majesty pays a daily visit when at Sandringham to
her pony-stable, which was built in 1874 for her four French
ponies, who were afterwards succeeded by equally valuable
animals of British extraction. Bina, Merry-Antics, Bow, and
Bell were the fortunate occupants of this model pony-stable,
which is considered the prettiest building of the kind in the
world, the walls being lined with white tiles, picked out in
green glazed bricks, finished at the top by a green-tiled frieze
and an open wooden roof. Above each manger was recorded
in gold letters the name of the pony occupying the stall.
Queen Alexandra at one time was very fond of driving tandem,
and she has one of the best tandem teams in Great Britain.
She is very fond of bay horses, and possesses also a pair of the
famous greys bred in the Imperial stables at Leipzig. For
many years Her Majesty always rode Kinsky, a Hungarian
horse; and she was said to be one of the best horsewomen in
Norfolk.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>The saddle-room is not the least fascinating portion of the
stable-yard. Much of the harness is silver and gold-plated.
Queen Alexandra has always preferred brown harness to black,
and all that used by her is made in tan leather, with brass
mounts.</p>

<p>There are a number of interesting photographs and paintings,
including a picture in oils of a very beautiful chestnut mare,
Victoria, long ridden by the Queen, and given to her when she
was a bride by Queen Victoria. Below this portrait of a
departed favourite is one of her hoofs mounted in silver, with
the name of the owner written across. There are some
valuable prints of celebrated trainers and jockeys, with some of
the latter’s whips, spurs, and caps. A “Vanity Fair” cartoon
of the King, surrounded by a number of his friends at Newmarket,
is also given a prominent place in the Sandringham
saddle-room; and not the least interesting memento now there
is Mr. John Porter’s silver-wedding gift to his Royal patrons.
In a silver frame, surmounted by the Prince of Wales’s feathers,
is a white velvet tablet with the name “Ormonde” woven from
the famous race-horse’s hair. The border contains pieces of
the hair of thirty-three famous winners, the name of each being
in silver letters beneath. Close by is to be seen the racing-saddle
generally used by Fred Archer.</p>

<p>Parallel with the stables runs the building known as the
kennels. At one time, in the paddock between the stables and
the kennels, there was a bear-pit, but the occupant thereof was
sent to the Zoo after the King’s valued head-keeper, Mr.
Jackson, had been hunted by Bruin just when he was about to
feed him with some peculiarly bearish delicacy. This corner
of Sandringham is by no means confined to horses and dogs.
Here also were kept some of Queen Alexandra’s pet cats; a
number of doves descended from the single pair presented to
Her Majesty during her first visit to Ireland; her Australian
pigeons, quite unlike the more humble home variety; a Barbary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
dove belonging to the Duchess of Cornwall and York; and
some very fine water-fowl, to say nothing of “Cockie,” the
Princess of Wales’s cockatoo, who was said to be over a
hundred years old.</p>

<p>The kennels are, in their way, quite as fine as the stables.
They are very cleverly arranged, all fitted with hot-water
pipes, and admirably ventilated. The dogs are exercised in
the park, in three paddocks in front of the kennels, or in a
large yard paved with red, blue, and brick tiles. All the food
consumed in the kennels comes from special kitchens attached
to the building. There is also a dog hospital and a nursery,
always occupied by one or more litters.</p>

<p>The King and Queen are both keen dog-fanciers, and they
possess some of the very finest animals in the world. They
both exhibit at the leading shows, and Her Majesty is the
Patron of the Ladies’ Kennel Association.</p>

<p>This chapter must not be concluded without reference to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
curious little book, published some years ago by one who must
be regarded as absolutely unique&mdash;namely, an aggrieved tenant
at Sandringham. This lady had differences with the agent of
the estate, and to revenge herself for her supposed grievances
she wrote this obviously prejudiced account of her late landlord
at his country home.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the book written by this hostile
witness are therefore significant indeed of the tenour of our
King’s life in Norfolk:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whenever I went (to Sandringham) I never failed to
spend a pleasant evening, and received more courtesy from
my illustrious host and hostess than from any house I ever
was in. The Prince is noted for his powers of entertainment
and exertion to make every one enjoy themselves. When a
‘house-party’ is expected he superintends the arrangements
and remembers their particular tastes and pursuits. A gouty
squire who once grumbled at having to go, was completely
mollified at finding a room prepared for him on the ground
floor, the Prince thinking he would prefer it. The effect of a
visit to Sandringham upon a certain order of Radicals, who are
treated with the greatest deference, is perfectly astounding.
It acts as a patent conjuring machine&mdash;a Republican stuffed
in at one end, a Courtier squeezed out at the other.</p>

<p>“The Sandringham festivities were so arranged that all
classes could share in them; and what with County, farmers’,
and servants’ balls, labourers’ dinners, visits to country houses,
meets of the hounds, and other sociabilities, everybody from far
and near had the opportunity of making acquaintance with
their Royal Highnesses.”</p>

<p>Of the servants’ parties at Sandringham she says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p>“The house party, equerries, ladies-in-waiting, and all
invited from the neighbourhood, were ordered to join in, no
shirking or sitting out allowed, and when the sides had been
made up, the Prince and Princess set off with their partners,
round and round, down the middle and up again, and so on
to the end, the Prince the jolliest of the jolly and the life of
the party, as he is wherever he goes. I never saw such
amazing vitality. His own Master of the Ceremonies, signalling
and sending messages to the band, arranging every dance,
and when to begin and when to leave off, noticing the smallest
mistake in the figures, and putting the people in their places.
In the ‘Triumph,’ which is such an exhausting dance, he looked
as if he could have gone on all night and into the middle of
next week without stopping, and I really believe he could.…
Almost before one dance was ended the Prince started
another, and suddenly the Scotch Pipers would screech out
and the Prince would fold his arms and fling himself into a
Highland fling, and so on fast and furious until far into the
small hours of the morning.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING IN LONDON</span></h2>

<p>Not long after the King’s accession, extensive alterations
were ordered to fit Buckingham Palace, which had been for
a long time only occupied occasionally, to be the town house
of His Majesty and Queen Alexandra. It is probable that
their Majesties would have preferred to remain at Marlborough
House, which is endeared to them by the most intimate associations,
both of joy and of sorrow; but in this, as in so many
other instances, the King divined by quick intuition that his
loyal subjects would wish that their Sovereign and his Consort
should reside in the palace which is not less closely linked
in the popular imagination with the British monarchy than
Windsor Castle itself.</p>

<p>It is evident that in all that concerns State ceremonial and
the <i>décor</i> of a magnificent Court, King Edward is resolved
to abate not a jot of his regal dignity. But so much of His
Majesty’s life was passed at Marlborough House, and the
beautiful old Georgian mansion was for so long the centre of
his social, philanthropic, and official activities, that no biographical
sketch of the King would be complete without some
account of what went on there.</p>

<p>There is scarcely an object in the house which does not
remind the King and Queen of some happy incident of their
joint lives. The very carpet in the drawing-room was presented
to them on the occasion of their wedding; and His
Majesty’s great interest in everything that concerns the history
of the country and of the Empire is strikingly shown in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of his homes, for the rooms of both Marlborough House and
Sandringham are lined with fine paintings and engravings
recalling great events of the Victorian era.</p>

<p>Although Marlborough House is the official residence of
the Heir-Apparent, it is considered a private house for taxation
purposes, and is rated at over £1000 a year.</p>

</div>

<p>The King’s study at Marlborough House, where none but
his intimates are admitted, looks like the room of a hard-working
man of business. He works at an old-fashioned
pedestal desk-table, exactly resembling the one used by his
father. The desk portion of the table shuts with a spring, and
can only be opened with a golden key, which the King always
wears on his watch chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was Prince of Wales the King only accomplished
the immense amount of work he did by the most methodical
organisation. Almost every hour of his day was mapped out
for him. First came his private correspondence, which was
very considerable. Then from ten to half-past ten was spent
in talking over and dictating replies to the letters already
sorted by Sir Francis Knollys. Immediately after, the Comptroller
of the Household discussed with him the arrangements
for the day. Often before lunch he had to receive a deputation,
or to act as chairman of some committee, frequently held
in Marlborough House. Luncheon was served at 2.30, and
the King and Queen often entertained parties of their relations
who were up in town for the day. Except when he was travelling,
the King rarely had a free afternoon, for even on the
rare occasions when he had not to visit some public institution,
to lay a foundation-stone, or to declare a building open, and
so on, there were endless social duties to which no one could
attend but himself, such as weddings, race meetings, reviews,
and receptions. Certain public functions were almost always
attended by both the King and the Queen&mdash;for example, the
Horse Show at Islington, the Royal Military Tournament, and
the trooping of the colour.</p>

<p>No one can realise how much his merely social duties cost
the King while he was Heir-Apparent. The invariable cheerfulness
and courage with which he went through what must
have soon become a terribly monotonous round, year after year,
are the more admirable when it is remembered that it was
actually made the basis for the assertion that he was excessively
devoted to mere amusement. An American writer who had
brought the charge but, having discovered his error, had had the
honesty and manliness to admit it, was rewarded by receiving a
letter from the Prince’s Secretary in which occurred the following:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Prince cannot help feeling that you are a little hard
and unjust upon him in your book; he says unjust because you
evidently wrote about him without knowing his real character.
There are many things which he is obliged to do which the
outside world would call pleasures and amusements; they are,
however, often anything but a source of amusement to him,
though his position demands that he should every year go
through a certain round of social duties which bore him to
death. But, while duly regretting those social pleasures, you
pass over very lightly all the more serious occupations of his life.”</p>

</div>

<p>As Heir-Apparent, the King gave each season a certain
number of dinners which, though in no sense official functions,
took the place of those which would in other circumstances
be given at Court. Thus he very often entertained various
members of the Opposition as well as of the Government. He
also occasionally gave what might be called a diplomatic dinner,
to which a number of the Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers
were invited. On many occasions dinner-parties in honour of
a foreign guest or Royal relation passing through town in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
semi-<i>incognito</i> have given members of London society an
opportunity of making the acquaintance of a great foreign
personage. When the Shahzada was in England the Prince and
Princess of Wales gave a banquet in his honour, at which
covers were laid for forty. On this occasion the principal
guest was not able to take any dish in the <i>menu</i> save <i>riz à
l’Impératrice</i>. Fortunately, however, he had brought with him
his own provisions.</p>

<p>The dining-room in which these important dinners were
served at Marlborough House is a very fine room containing
a considerable number of their Majesties’ wedding presents. It
is a curious fact that in no circumstances were two knives
together given to any guest. A great many reasons have been
assigned for this rule, but apparently no one ever adopted the
simple plan of asking the Royal host or hostess. It has been
asserted that the King has the old-fashioned dislike to seeing
knives inadvertently crossed.</p>

<p>Here is a lively description of a dinner at Marlborough
House on 6th May 1896, recorded by the late Archbishop
Benson in his diary:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>“Dined with the Prince of Wales. The most splendid
company. All the Ambassadors but Russia, who is gone to
the Coronation of the Czar. Duke of Connaught, Lord
Wolseley, near whom I sat, with the Lord Chancellor between,
two delightful, interesting talkers, and on my other side one
still better, de Courcel, French Ambassador. Lucklessly after
dinner the Turkish Ambassador asked to be presented, and he
held me talking innocently about the Greek Bishops whom I
knew, but for his red-handed tyrant’s sake he was the last
person I wished for, and Harcourt came up and said, ‘What
a picture we have been enjoying&mdash;you and the Turk in close
alliance!’ Then Harcourt went on about our old Cambridge
days, and in heart he is the greatest Conservative. At the
Prince of Wales’s instigation I did my best to make Duke of
Connaught see it was good for Church and State that Bishop
of Peterborough should go for us, and perhaps I succeeded a
little; he promised to do his best to make him welcome there.
Chamberlain, Morley, Balfour, two Directors of British Museum,
Asquith, very pleasant after his dangerous but not damaging
assault on the Education Bill, Rosebery, Herschell, Salisbury
of course, looking a very great man, among the Ambassadors.”</p>

<p>The journey of the Bishop of Peterborough (Dr. Creighton,
afterwards Bishop of London), to which the Archbishop refers,
was to Russia to represent the Church of England at the Tsar’s
Coronation.</p>

<p>The King has never concealed his dislike of the immensely
long, fatiguing banquets which were in his youth the rule rather
than the exception; indeed, he may be said to have revolutionised
the British dinner-party. At Marlborough House
dinner was never allowed to last much over an hour. Occasionally
during dinner soft music was played. Every course served
was prepared under the direct supervision of the <i>chef</i> (the famous
Ménager).</p>

<p>Some years ago the King was rarely seen, even at dinner
at a private house, without his favourite valet Macdonald, the
son of the Prince Consort’s <i>jager</i>; and later, whenever the
King dined out, one of his own servants invariably accompanied
him and attended to him through the dinner, whether it was a
public banquet or a private dinner-party. Indeed, the King
very rarely enjoyed the luxury of being alone; even when walking
up St. James’s Street, or turning into the Marlborough
Club, he was almost invariably accompanied by one of his
equerries; and it need hardly be said that the most trustworthy
detectives in the London police force were charged with the
task of watching over his personal safety, for the appearance
of no public personage was better known to the man in the
street than that of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>The King has always been an enthusiastic admirer of the
stage, and his tastes are so catholic that they range from melodrama
at the Adelphi to grand opera at Covent Garden. When
His Majesty had made up his mind that he would like to go
to the theatre, the Royal box was booked in the ordinary way
of business, and charged to the Marlborough House account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the price not being increased from the ordinary library tariff.
The only difference made in honour of the Royal family is that,
if any other patron of the theatre has already engaged the
Royal box, he is requested to waive his right. The King,
however, is always reluctant that this should be done, and he
generally requests his secretary to send a special note of thanks
in his name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Garden Party at Marlborough House, July 1881</span></p>

<p><i>From the “Illustrated London News”</i></p>

</div>

<p>Both the King and the Queen always desired to be treated
exactly as if they belonged to the ordinary audience, and
nothing annoyed them more than that attention should be
drawn to them by the playing of the National Anthem or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> “God
bless the Prince of Wales.” At one time the managers used
to keep the curtain down till the Royal party arrived. The
King heard of this, and was so greatly troubled at the thought
of the inconvenience thus caused to the public that he gave
strict orders that the curtain was never to be kept down
beyond the advertised time on his account. On the other
hand, he always makes a point of waiting till the final curtain
has come down before rising to leave. The only occasions on
which he ever breaks this courteous rule is when he goes to a
theatre which has no private entrance. Then the King and
Queen always anticipate the final curtain by two or three
minutes, so that their departure may not disturb the carriage
arrangements of the rest of the audience.</p>

<p>London managers have reason to be grateful to the King,
for whenever he has visited a theatre the booking sensibly
increases, the more so that when he likes a play he goes again
and again, and recommends it to all his friends. Even when
he finds it impossible himself to attend the benefit of some
well-known actor or actress, he always puts his name down for
stalls or boxes to a substantial amount.</p>

<p>At the opera the King occupied an “omnibus,” a double
box on the ground tier, the Royal box itself being on the tier
above; while Queen Alexandra had a box all to herself, where
she was usually accompanied by one of her daughters. The
King is a great music-lover, and, unlike many <i>habitués</i>, attends
appreciatively throughout the performance. He was often
attended at the opera by his old friend, the late Earl of Lathom,
but he never had ladies in his box, although during the <i>entr’actes</i>
he would often visit the Princess and his daughters in their box.</p>

<p>The King’s interest in the dramatic profession is unaffected
and sincere. Some years ago a very interesting theatrical
dinner took place at Marlborough House, Sir Henry Irving,
Sir Squire Bancroft, Mr. Hare, Mr. Kendal, Mr. Toole, Mr.
Wyndham, Mr. Beerbohm Tree, Mr. Alexander, Mr. David
James, Mr. Arthur Cecil, and Mr. William Farren being asked
to meet the Duke of Fife, Sir Christopher Teesdale, Mr. Sala,
Mr. Burnand, and Mr. Pinero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty has always patronised the French plays when
performed in London, and he is as popular with the French
theatrical world as he is with the dramatic profession in
London.</p>

<p>A separate chapter might almost be written about the King
as a smoker. At Sandringham he has a large number of cigar-cases
and tobacco-boxes, presented to him at various times by
relatives and friends, and at Marlborough House he has an
immense collection of silver cigar-lighters. His Majesty is as
generous in the matter of cigars as he is in the more important
affairs of life, and in this connection a story is told which, if it
is not true, certainly ought to be. It is said that on one
occasion, before his accession, when attending a big fire, His
Majesty asked a reporter for some details, which were instantly
given. At the conclusion of the conversation, the King offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his informant a cigar, which the latter immediately wrapped up
in a page of his note-book and placed in his pocket. “Don’t
you smoke?” asked the King. “Oh yes,” said the reporter;
“but I am not likely ever to get another cigar from the Prince
of Wales.” His Majesty laughed, and once more producing
his cigar-case said, “You had better have another one, this
time to smoke.”</p>

<p>The King was at one time very fond of taking a hansom in
the streets of London, just like an ordinary person, and it is
said that he always paid the driver half a sovereign whether
the distance was long or short. His Majesty is patron of the
Cabdrivers’ Benevolent Association, and he takes a marked
interest in these hard-worked and deserving servants of the
public, seldom missing the annual meeting, at which, indeed,
some of his best speeches have been delivered.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the King need never take
a hansom except for his own amusement. The stables of
Marlborough House are, from every point of view, models of
what town stables ought to be. In the coach-houses are some
interesting carriages. The State Coach, which was practically
never used, is almost exactly like that which is kept at
Buckingham Palace. A Russian sociable, lined with dark-blue
morocco, was a gift from the late Tsar of Russia to
Queen Alexandra, but it was considered too showy for the
London streets, and Her Majesty preferred a light victoria,
which was generally drawn by her two greys, Chelsea and Brief.</p>

<p>The greatest care had to be taken both by the King
and by the Queen in selecting the tradesmen upon whom to
confer the undoubted advantage of their custom. Sir Dighton
Probyn, who was Comptroller of the Prince of Wales’s Household,
and has since been appointed Extra Equerry to His
Majesty, was entrusted with the duty of seeing that the
Warrants were only given to those who were worthy of
them. A Royal Warrant is naturally considered a great
honour by the recipient, and any firm aspiring to be a
Warrant-Holder must supply the Household for one year in
a satisfactory manner before becoming eligible; and should the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
firm become bankrupt, or even change its name, the Warrant
must be returned to the Comptroller of the Household.</p>

<p>On the King’s birthday the Warrant-Holders were wont
to dine together, and on the <i>menu</i> always figured some venison
contributed both by Queen Victoria and by King Edward, who
each sent a fine buck. On all Royal occasions of rejoicing the
Warrant-Holders are considered to have a special right to
present a gift accompanied by their congratulations.</p>

<p>Every monetary transaction was not only recorded, but
indexed at Marlborough House, and any tradesman who sent
in an account twice over was never again patronised.</p>

<p>The King does not confine his custom to any one London
tailor; on the contrary, he is careful to distribute his patronage,
and it is a mistake to fancy that His Majesty pays very
much more for his clothes than do other people. His wardrobe
is necessarily larger and more varied than that of a private
individual. It need hardly be said that he dresses in perfect
taste, and it is well known that he has no sympathy with
the revolutionists who would abolish the frock-coat. He is,
however, also understood to have a special fondness for the
old-fashioned “bowler” hat. It would be difficult to overestimate
the King’s influence as an arbiter of fashion, especially in
America, where every trifling change in his costume is faithfully
reported and imitated, and also on the Continent. On the
whole, his influence in matters of dress is strongly conservative.
He has none of the Continental love of displaying uniforms,
and his dress is always the acme of good taste, because it is
always absolutely suitable to the occasion on which it is worn.</p>

<p>The King has an ever-increasing number of uniforms,
military and other, which are worth quite £15,000, and are,
of course, fully insured. It need hardly be said that the King
has almost every Order in existence. The mere enumeration
of them fills up a large space in Debrett.</p>

<p>The King’s own favourite among his Orders used to be
that of Malta, the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem,
of which the badge is the well-known Maltese cross suspended
from a black ribbon.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE KING AND STATE POLICY</span></h2>

<p>The King has on several occasions, notably in his Message to
his People, published on his accession, expressed his resolve to
follow in the footsteps of his late deeply-lamented mother in
fulfilling the great and sacred responsibilities which at her
death he was summoned to undertake. The chief of these
responsibilities is that which relates to high State policy, and
especially to the intricate and delicate problems arising out of
our relations with foreign Powers.</p>

<p>Now, not the least service which Queen Victoria rendered
to her people, as Lord Salisbury said in the eloquent tribute
which he paid to her memory in the House of Lords, was her
constant and rigorous supervision over public affairs. The
people saw only the result, the finished policy, associated in
their minds with the personality of some popular Minister.
What they did not know was how far that policy had been
modified, perhaps even completely recast, by the sagacious
counsels of their Sovereign, or what pitfalls had been avoided
by her warnings, frankly offered, yet never obstinately pressed
upon the chosen representatives of her beloved subjects. “Let
us have the Queen’s opinion,” said Lord Clarendon, one of the
shrewdest of her Foreign Ministers. “It is always worth
hearing, even if you do not agree with it.” And Lord
Kimberley confessed that when he was at the Foreign Office
he had a difference of opinion with Queen Victoria in regard to
an important matter. After discussion Her Majesty, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
unconvinced, yielded to her Minister; but the event proved
that she was right and the Minister wrong.</p>

<p>Such glimpses of the inner working of the great machine of
Government illustrate for us the path which King Edward has
marked out for himself. Our polity has been called a crowned
Republic&mdash;a phrase which, in spite of its exaggeration, expresses
tersely the fact that the constitutional Sovereign of
this realm has constantly to reconcile duties which seem far
apart, and even sometimes inconsistent. King Edward succeeds
to a Monarchy possessing great theoretical powers,
which, however, have been by the slow growth of custom
practically restricted to the exercise of an indirect, advisory
influence on State affairs, though, as Mr. Balfour said in the
House of Commons, this influence shows a tendency to increase
rather than to diminish. Queen Victoria was once compared
to a Permanent Under-Secretary of State, who sees Ministers
come and go, succeed and fail, but himself remains. The
comparison is not a bad one, except that the work of a
permanent Under-Secretary is confined to one department,
whereas the Sovereign is concerned, not only with every
branch of the public service, but also with many matters of
importance which cannot pass through the hands of any State
department.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the great responsibilities, as well as the
great opportunities, which are inseparable from the British
Crown, and perhaps it is not impertinent to point out how well
King Edward VII. is fitted to meet them. The extraordinary
tact which characterises His Majesty is most clearly illustrated
when we consider his relations towards the policy of the State.
There was a time in the history of England when the Prince
of Wales allied himself with one of the political parties in the
country, and that not the one in which his father had confidence.
The tradition of constitutional monarchy established by our
late beloved Queen necessarily inaugurated a different <i>régime</i>.
No political party was ever able honestly to claim the Prince
of Wales as an adherent, or even as a platonic sympathiser.
On the other hand, not his severest critics ever accused him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
apathy to British interests. In that higher sphere of patriotism
which rises superior to the din of party politics he thoroughly
earned the title of the typical Englishman.</p>

<p>All through the years which succeeded the death of the
Prince Consort the Prince of Wales discharged the duties of
his position in such a way as to win the confidence of every
section of the nation. He included among his friends the
principal men of both the great political parties, and with such
delicacy of feeling was this done that no one could justly say
which he really preferred. Indeed, so nice was his feeling that
he was accustomed to distinguish&mdash;if he made any distinction
at all&mdash;those statesmen who happened to be in Opposition at
the moment, rather than those who were enjoying the sweets
of office.</p>

<p>The King did not escape the penalty of irresponsible gossip.
He undoubtedly displayed a great liking for Ireland, and for
the Irish people, but it would be absurd to call him on that
account a Home Ruler. Similarly, it is an interesting fact that
both His Majesty and Queen Alexandra distinguished Mr. and
Mrs. Gladstone by some special tokens of friendship, but it is
not justifiable on that account to assert that their Majesties
are Liberals. The truth is that throughout his career His
Majesty has succeeded, while deeply interesting himself in
politics, in steering steadily clear of party politics.</p>

<p>It would be wearisome to enumerate all the statesmen and
politicians on whom His Majesty has conferred various marks
of his favour. Mention may, however, be made of Mr. Cecil
Rhodes, for whom he entertains a strong admiration which he
has never cared to conceal. Indeed, he removed his own name
from the Travellers’ Club when Mr. Rhodes was blackballed&mdash;a
course which he has never seen fit to take in any other
instance.</p>

<p>The political emancipation of the Jews in England evidently
had the King’s warm sympathy. It now seems a long time
ago since his presence at the marriage of Mr. Leopold de
Rothschild caused much satisfaction and some sensation in
Jewish circles, for no British prince had visited a synagogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
since 1809, when three of the Royal dukes were present at
a Jewish service. The Rothschild family have long been
among His Majesty’s personal friends, both in England and on
the Continent, and among his intimates was the late Baron
Hirsch, with whom he stayed in Austria, notwithstanding the
intense anti-Semitic prejudices of the Austrian Court. The
King has thoroughly studied the question of the Russian Jews,
and has interested himself on their behalf in such a way as
should earn for him the gratitude of every Jew in Europe and
America. Nevertheless His Majesty’s liking for the Chosen
People has been sometimes misinterpreted, and ascribed to not
very creditable motives. People were at one time fond of
saying that the King was up to the neck in debt, but, when
the question was directly asked, Sir Francis Knollys replied
that the King had no debts worth speaking of, and that he
could pay any moment every farthing he owed; also, that there
was not a word of truth in the oft-repeated tales of the mortgage
on Sandringham, and that the whole story was a fabrication
and was on a par with similar tales representing the King
as being assisted by financiers of more or less doubtful honesty.</p>

<p>In the sphere of foreign relations His Majesty’s indirect
influence has undoubtedly been considerable, though, of course,
the time has gone by when dynastic considerations used to
dictate the policy of empires. It is well known that his nephew,
the Tsar, entertains for him a strong personal regard; while of
the feelings which subsist between His Majesty and the Kaiser,
the son of his favourite sister, the country has had the most
significant illustrations. There can be no doubt, too, about
the feelings of esteem which are entertained for His Majesty
by the French nation as a whole. Furthermore, the King has
always shown his desire to become personally acquainted with
the principal statesmen of Europe; and it is probable that few
of the men who now control international relations have not at
one time or another fallen under the influence of His Majesty’s
gracious and winning personality. The sum of all this must
count for a good deal in facilitating the conduct of our foreign
relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>For Americans the King has shown a strong liking, but
it is absurd to assert that his favour has been confined to those
American men and women whose social position has been
entirely purchased by their wealth. He has frequently gone
out of his way to show special courtesy to distinguished
American visitors, whether rich or poor; and the diplomatic
representative of the United States in London has always
found a specially cordial welcome at Marlborough House. This
was particularly the case with James Russell Lowell and with
T. F. Bayard. Indeed, it will be remembered that on Mr.
Bayard’s giving up the post of American Ambassador, the
King broke his rule and accepted Mr. Bayard’s invitation to
dinner, thereby paying a signal compliment to the whole
American people. The King’s telegram to the <i>New York
World</i>, during the war-scare which followed President Cleveland’s
Venezuelan Message, will be remembered as having
done much to calm the public anxiety in both countries.</p>

<p>American women who have married Englishmen can rely
on receiving from the King and Queen Alexandra the most
tactful consideration and courtesy. This was conspicuously
shown in the cases of Lady Harcourt, the daughter of Motley,
the great American historian; of Mrs. Joseph Chamberlain;
and of the young Duchess of Marlborough.</p>

<p>It is no slight testimony to His Majesty’s political insight
that at a time when the Colonies were not fashionable, and
when they were actually regarded as a source of weakness
rather than of strength to the Mother Country, he did all that
he could&mdash;so far as the traditional restrictions of his position
would allow&mdash;to foster a different view of Britain’s relations
with her daughter-States. Since those days he exerted himself
to promote the success of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition;
and his interest in the Empire was yet more strikingly
demonstrated in the foundation of the Imperial Institute. His
Majesty’s gracious Message to his People Beyond the Seas
further illustrates his interest in his Colonial dominions, but
assuredly the crowning testimony is his consent to part with
his son and his daughter-in-law for many months that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
might inaugurate the Australian Federal Parliament and visit
the other important States of the Empire.</p>

<p>His Majesty’s interest in India, too, is strong, and his
knowledge of Indian affairs is very wide. Every new book of
any importance which is published on any Indian subject is
added to His Majesty’s library, which is by this time extremely
rich in works relating to the vast Eastern territories over
which he is now Emperor. His Majesty’s visit to these great
kingdoms and provinces, to which he made graceful allusion
in his Message “to the Princes and Peoples of India,” was paid
at the express wish of his mother, who saw with characteristic
foresight how valuable it would be in promoting peace and conciliation
among the various creeds and races of Hindustan.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING AND THE SERVICES</span></h2>

<p>Only three days after the irreparable loss of his much-loved
mother, King Edward wrote Messages to the Navy and the
Army, which demonstrated how great is his pride in both the
services, and how deeply he has their interests at heart. The
Message to the Navy, which was ordered by the Lords of
the Admiralty to be read on the quarter-deck of every ship
in commission, in the presence of the ship’s company, was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Osborne</span>, <i>25th January 1901</i>.</p>

<p>“I am desirous of expressing to the Navy my heartfelt
thanks for its distinguished and renowned services during the
long and glorious reign of my beloved mother the Queen, to
whose Throne I now succeed.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty, ever proud of the great deeds of her Navy,
the protector of our shores and commerce, watched with the
keenest solicitude its vast progress during her reign, and made
it the profession of my late lamented brother, as I also chose
it for the early education of both my sons.</p>

<p>“Watching over your interests and well-being, I confidently
rely upon that unfailing loyalty which is the proud inheritance
of your noble service.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edward, R. et I.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The King as Admiral of the Fleet</span></p>

<p><i>From a Photograph by Russell</i></p>

</div>

<p>On the publication of the official March Navy List&mdash;there
was no issue for February 1901&mdash;it was seen that the words
“The King” appeared at the head of the Service. This had
been done before in lists published by private enterprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
but never before in the list published “by authority.” The
circumstance that, while in the Army List Queen Victoria
appeared as the head of the land forces, a similar course was
not taken in the Navy List had always been regarded as
curious, especially considering that the sea service is designated
the “Royal” Navy, while the Army is not so described.
When an official Navy List was first issued in January 1814
there was no indication in it of the monarch’s existence. The
Duke of Clarence appeared as the only Admiral of the Fleet
with a commission dated 27th December 1811, and he continued
to appear in each list as it was issued quarterly up to
March 1830. In the next list, dated in June of the same year,
by which time he had succeeded as William IV., his name had
disappeared, and for all the lists tell us he might have entirely
severed his connection from the Navy.</p>

<p>The introduction of the King’s name into the official Navy
List did not of course mean any diminution of the power and
authority conferred on the Lords Commissioners for executing
the office of the Lord High Admiral, but merely that His
Majesty desired to associate himself personally with the Navy,
of which he had become the head. The change simply emphasised
the fact that the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines
are the loyal and devoted servants of the King, and it is another
instance of that gracious tact for which Edward VII. is renowned.</p>

<p>Debarred by the tradition of his House from himself
entering our first line of defence, the King nevertheless&mdash;as
indeed he says in his gracious Message&mdash;chose the Navy for
the early education of both his sons. In other ways he has
never failed to demonstrate in every possible way his love of
the sea, of which indeed he has had a pretty wide experience.
We have seen how often he took passage in various warships
on his travels, and it will be remembered that the <i>Hero</i>, in
which he returned from visiting Canada and the United States,
was driven by a storm out of her course and the Royal party
were reduced to salt fare. His Majesty thus early made
acquaintance with the hardships as well as with the pleasant
side of a sailor’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>King William IV. once said: “There is no place in the
world for making an English gentleman like the quarter-deck
of an English man-of-war,” and his great-nephew, King
Edward, evidently took the same view. It was in 1877 that
an important step was taken in regard to the education of the
King’s two sons, which had long been the subject of anxious
thought and care to both their parents. It had not hitherto
been the custom to send Princes in the direct line of succession
into the Navy, that service being no doubt considered too
hazardous. But the strong affection subsisting between Prince
Albert Victor and Prince George made their father unwilling
to separate them, and so in June 1877 they entered the
<i>Britannia</i> together as naval cadets. The decision significantly
showed how highly His Majesty appreciated the naval service
as a mental and moral training school.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in that eventful year, 1887, His
Majesty was appointed an Honorary Admiral of the Fleet;
and later on, the marriage of his daughter, Princess Maud,
to Prince Charles of Denmark, who was a Lieutenant in the
Danish Navy, gave His Majesty peculiar gratification.</p>

<p>The King’s Message to the Army, contained in a special
Army order, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Osborne</span>, <i>25th January 1901</i>.</p>

<p>“On my accession to the Throne of my ancestors I am
desirous of thanking the Army for the splendid services which
it has rendered to my beloved mother the Queen during her
glorious reign of upwards of sixty-three years.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty invariably evinced the warmest interest in
her troops, especially when on active service, both as a
Sovereign and as the head of her Army, and she was proud
of the fact of being a soldier’s daughter.</p>

<p>“To secure your best interests will be one of the dearest
objects of my heart, and I know I can count upon that loyal
devotion which you ever evinced towards your late Sovereign.</p>

</div>

<p>A further honour was in store for the Army, for the <i>London
Gazette</i> announced:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">War Office, Pall Mall</span>, <i>26th February 1901</i>.</p>

<p>“The King has been pleased to confer upon the undermentioned
Regiments the honour of becoming their Colonel-in-Chief
on his accession to the Throne:&mdash;</p>

<p>“10th (Prince of Wales’s Own Royal) Hussars, of which
Regiment he has been the Regimental Colonel since the year
1863.</p>

<p>“Grenadier Guards.</p>

<p>“Coldstream Guards.</p>

<p>“Scots Guards.</p>

<p>“Irish Guards.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was felt by the whole Army to be a special honour,
for the four regiments of Foot Guards had previously had only
Colonels commanding, not Colonels-in-Chief. It will be
remembered that the 10th Hussars was the regiment in which
the late Duke of Clarence and Avondale served.</p>

<p>The connection of His Majesty with the Army has, in
accordance with precedent, been extremely close and long
continued. Among the earliest recollections of his childhood
is the Crimean War, which undoubtedly made a deep and
lasting impression on his mind. On attaining the age of
eighteen His Majesty was gazetted a Colonel in the Army.
Four years later he was promoted to be a General; and in
1875 he was created a Field-Marshal. The mere catalogue of
his Colonelcies and Honorary Colonelcies would be tedious;
but it may be mentioned that he is Colonel-in-Chief of the 1st
and 2nd Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards, and the Gordon
Highlanders. His Majesty is also Colonel of a large number
of distinguished foreign regiments. These latter, however, are
naturally formal distinctions, which, in these days, are not of
military so much as diplomatic significance. The interest
which the King takes in military matters is undoubtedly chiefly
centred in the British Army.</p>

<p>The King’s military service at the Curragh has been described
in an earlier chapter. His mind was also undoubtedly
influenced by the companions whom his parents selected to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
with him when he set up a separate establishment. Of these,
two were soldiers of conspicuous bravery&mdash;Major Teesdale,
afterwards Sir Christopher Teesdale, who had greatly distinguished
himself at Kars; and Major Lindsay, V.C., afterwards
Lord Wantage. King Edward’s keen interest in all
that concerns the art of war is well exemplified by his careful
survey of the battlefields of the Crimea, and by his visiting,
during his tour in India, the places rendered for ever memorable
by the Mutiny.</p>

<p>The deep interest which His Majesty took in the Boer War
will be fresh in the recollection of everybody. Accompanied
by the Duke of Cambridge, he said good-bye, on 14th October
1899, to Sir Redvers Buller, departing to take up the command
in South Africa. Later on, accompanied by his brother, the
Duke of Connaught, he saw Lord Roberts off on that cold
winter morning when the Commander-in-Chief, in the midst
of his own bitter private grief, left for South Africa, sped by
the deep sympathy and encouragement of His Majesty. It
will be remembered, too, how frequently the King inspected
battalions ordered to the front, encouraging them with his
outspoken interest and admiration; and it will be remembered
not less vividly how his gracious Consort cared for the wounded
and invalided soldiers, whose sufferings are the inevitable price
of victory. The <i>Princess of Wales</i> Hospital Ship will never
be forgotten by a grateful nation.</p>

<p>The King and Queen Alexandra were among the earliest
subscribers to the Mansion-House funds for the relief of the
Transvaal refugees and of the sufferers from the war. The
death of their nephew, Major Prince Christian Victor, who was
stricken down by disease in October 1900 while on active
service in South Africa, was a deep grief to their Majesties.
The beginning of the year 1901 was signalised by the return
of Lord Roberts and by Queen Alexandra’s special appeal on
behalf of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Families Association, which
brought relief to many a stricken family whose head had fallen
at the front.</p>

</div>

<p>In the reception of Lord Roberts the King took a prominent
part. Accompanied by Queen Alexandra, and their son and
daughter-in-law and Princess Victoria, His Majesty, as representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
his Royal Mother, presided at the State luncheon
at Buckingham Palace in honour of the Commander-in-Chief,
while only a few days before Queen Victoria’s death the King
took the chair at the great banquet at which the United Service
Club entertained Lord Roberts.</p>

<p>The services of the Colonial contingents in South Africa
made a profound impression on the King’s mind. He showed
this in the most significant manner when, brushing aside all
antiquated War Office precedents, he not only inspected
Strathcona’s Horse in the garden of Buckingham Palace and
gave them the South African Medal in advance before its
general issue, but actually presented the regiment with a colour.
That such honour should be conferred on a corps of irregulars
doubtless shocked military pedants, but it caused intense pride
and gratification to the gallant Canadians, who in their modesty
refused to believe that their services had been anything out of
the common.</p>

<div class="smaller">

indebted to an authority on the subject.</i></p>

</div>

<p>After the King’s accession His Majesty reluctantly decided
that he could not hope to find time to fulfil the duties of the
high offices in Masonry to which he had been called as Prince
of Wales, namely Grand Master of English Freemasons
and Grand Master of the Mark Degree. At the same time
King Edward was unwilling to cut short his long official connection
with Masonry. Accordingly, His Majesty graciously
intimated, in a letter read at Grand Lodge on 15th February
1901, that, following the precedent of King George IV., he
would, on his retirement from the office of Grand Master, take
the title of “Protector of English Freemasons.” Similarly,
at a Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons held four days later,
it was announced that His Majesty would assume the title of
“Patron of Freemasons of the Mark Degree.”</p>

<p>The King was succeeded in both his Grand Masterships
by his brother, the Duke of Connaught, whose consent to
serve gave great satisfaction to the brethren of the craft.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Freemasonry has been one of the most
absorbing interests of the King’s life. Yet very few foreign
princes are Masons; and though the Duke of Kent was one,
the Prince Consort always refused to associate himself with the
craft. Of course it must be remembered that British Freemasonry
is a very different thing from what the term is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
supposed to imply on the Continent, where it is associated in
the public mind with atheism and even anarchism.</p>

<p>As far back as March 1870 the King presided at the
anniversary festival of the Royal Masonic Institution for Boys.
This was not very long after his initiation, and in his speech
he expressed his pride at being so heartily received by the
company as a brother Mason, and his determination to follow
in the footsteps of his grand-uncles, who were so long connected
with the craft. The King continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Much has been said against Freemasonry by those who
do not know what it is. People naturally say they do not
approve of secret societies; but I maintain that the craft is free
from the reproach of being either disloyal or irreligious.…
I desire to remind you that when, about seventy years ago, it
became necessary for the Government of that day to put down
secret societies, my relative, the late Duke of Sussex, urged in
his place in Parliament that Freemasons’ lodges ought to be
exempt from such a law, and the force of his appeal was
acknowledged. From that time Freemasonry has been devoid
of politics, its only object being the pure and Christian one of
charity.”</p>

<p>In May of the following year the King presided at the
annual festival of the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls, and
announced that Queen Alexandra had consented to become the
Patroness of the institution. His Majesty also expressed his
thanks to the brethren for their sympathy with him on the
death of his infant son in the preceding month.</p>

<p>It is interesting to record, in view of the King’s present
title of Patron of Freemasons of the Mark Degree, that His
Majesty, who was already Patron of the Order in Scotland, was
installed as Patron of Free and Accepted Masons in Ireland on
the occasion of his visit to that country in August 1871. The
installation was attended with great ceremony, and in the course
of his reply to the address of welcome presented to him the
King said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<p>“It was a source of considerable satisfaction to me when I
was elected a member of the craft, and I think I may, without
presumption, point to the different Masonic meetings which, since
my initiation, I have fraternally attended. As a proof of the
interest I take in all that relates to Freemasonry, I can assure
you that it has afforded me great gratification to become the
Patron of the Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free
and Accepted Masons in Ireland, and that an opportunity has
been given to me by my visit to Ireland of being installed here
to-day.”</p>

<p>The Grand Master then clothed the King with the collar,
apron, and jewel as Patron. The brethren, according to
ancient custom, saluted him as Patron of the Order in Ireland,
the Grand Master himself giving the word, and His Majesty
then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have now to thank you heartily and cordially for your
fraternal reception, and for the honour you have done me, and
I beg to assure you of the pleasure I feel on having been
invited to become the Patron of the Order of Freemasons in
Ireland. It is a source of considerable satisfaction to me to
know that my visit to this country has afforded this opportunity
of meeting you, brethren, in Lodge, and so interchanging these
frank and hearty greetings. It is true I have not been a Mason
very long. I was initiated, as you perhaps know, in London, a
few years ago, after which I visited the Grand Original Lodge
of Denmark, and a short time afterwards I had the signal satisfaction
of being elected a Past Grand Master of the United
Grand Lodge of England. Last year I had the honour of
being elected Patron of the Order in Scotland; and, brethren,
though last, not least, comes the special honour you have conferred
on me. I thank you for it from the bottom of my heart.
I may, I think, refer with some pride to the number of Masonic
meetings I have attended in England since my initiation as a
proof of my deep attachment to your Order.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>“I know&mdash;we all know&mdash;how good and holy a thing Freemasonry
is, how excellent are its principles, and how perfect
the doctrine it sets forth; but forgive me if I remind you that
some of our friends outside are not as well acquainted with its
merits as we are ourselves, and that a most mistaken idea
prevails in some minds that, because we are a secret society,
we meet for political purposes, or have a political bias in what
we do. I am delighted, brethren, to have this opportunity of
proclaiming what I am satisfied you will agree with me in&mdash;that
we have, as Masons, no politics; that the great object of our
Order is to strengthen the bonds of fraternal affection, and to
make us live in pure and Christian love with all men; that
though a secret, we are not a political body; and that our
Masonic principles and hopes are essential parts of our attachment
to the Constitution and loyalty to the Crown.”</p>

<p>No doubt the most impressive Masonic ceremony ever
attended by the King was his installation as Grand Master of
English Freemasons in the Royal Albert Hall on 28th April
1875, to which office he was elected on the resignation of the
Marquis of Ripon. The scene was striking in the extreme.
The platform usually occupied by the choir was transformed
into a daïs, on which the throne was placed, the space around
being large enough for four or five hundred Provincial Grand
Masters, Past Grand Officers, and visitors of distinction. The
throne was the one in which King George IV. was installed
when he was Prince of Wales. It was covered with rich
purple velvet, and the floor was laid with a magnificent
Oriental carpet, a century old, lent for the occasion by a
member of the Westminster and Keystone Lodge. Behind
the throne the banner of Grand Lodge and other flags were
placed; in front a wide aisle was formed right across the area
to the Royal entrance. This was laid with a rich carpet of
velvet pile, woven expressly for the occasion. The ground was
blue, enriched alternately with the arms of Grand Lodge and
Prince of Wales’s feathers.</p>

<p>It is recorded that when the King entered the hall the
enthusiasm of the brethren was so great that the proper order
of the ceremonial was forgotten, and the Grand Master Elect
was greeted with extraordinarily vehement, but quite irregular
plaudits.</p>

<p>In returning thanks after his installation, His Majesty delivered
an appropriate speech, in the course of which he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is difficult for me to find words adequate to express my
deep thanks for the honour which has already been bestowed
upon me&mdash;an honour which has, as history bears testimony,
been bestowed upon several members of my family, my predecessors;
and, brethren, it will always be my most sincere
and ardent wish to walk in the footsteps of good men who
have preceded me, and, with God’s help, to fulfil the duties
which I have been called upon to occupy to-day. The various
duties which I have to perform will frequently, I am afraid,
not permit me to attend so much to the duties of the craft as
I should desire; but you may be assured that when I have
the time I shall do the utmost to maintain this high position,
and do my duty by the craft and by you on every possible
occasion. Every Englishman knows that the two great watchwords
of the craft are Loyalty and Charity. These are their
watchwords, and as long as Freemasons do not, as Freemasons,
mix themselves up in politics, so long I am sure this high and
noble Order will flourish, and will maintain the integrity of
our great Empire. I thank you once more, brethren, for your
cordial reception of me to-day, and I thank you for having come
such immense distances to welcome me on this occasion. I
assure you I shall never forget to-day&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>The last sentence, obviously an impromptu, was uttered with
much emphasis and evidently deep feeling.</p>

<p>At the banquet which followed in the evening the King, in
proposing the health of the King of Sweden and Norway, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It affords me especial pleasure to propose this toast, as
seven years ago I became a member of this craft, initiated by
the late King, the brother of the present one. Thereby I
consider I have a more special interest in Sweden.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in spite of his numerous other duties,
the new Grand Master did find time to attend a considerable
number of Masonic functions. Not the least interesting of
these was his laying the foundation stone of Truro Cathedral
on 20th May 1880, of which the late Archbishop Benson, then
Bishop of Truro, wrote the following vivid description, quoted
in that prelate’s <i>Life</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“The ceremonial of the Freemasons, which some regarded
with suspicion and dislike, was satisfactory and refreshing from
its simple exposition of symbolism as an element in life, quite
apart from ecclesiasticism. I had, upon the first mooting of
the question by the Prince, taken the opinion of the Rural
Deans as representative of the clergy, and their unanimous
opinion was that it was even desirable to use an old guild in
this way, provided that the Church Service and order were in
no way interfered with. And the Prince, both through Lord
Mount Edgcumbe, and at Marlborough House himself, said
that nothing should be done except in full accord with my own
arrangements as Bishop and the usual forms.… The dignity
and the simplicity and naturalness with which the Prince
poured the corn and wine and oil over the stone added much
to the ceremony, and the force and clearness with which he
delivered the impressive little sermon, ending with an excellent
passage of Ezra, chosen by Lord Mount Edgcumbe, rang out
of a really serious spirit.… The colours of the Masons, which
look quaint on the individual, looked very soft in the mass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>
<p>“The most striking moment was when the procession of
military and naval authorities and deputy lieutenants came
sweeping in with a great curve, leading the Princess and her
boys. She was received by our tall Mayor in his stately new
furred gown and me, and taken up to her throne. At the end
she was led to the newly-laid stone and seated by it, while a
long train of girls brought their purses and laid them before
her, after the little Princes had each presented £250 in behalf
of Miss Goldsworthy Gurney, who wished thus to memorialise
her father’s invention of the steam jet. The Prince of Wales
was timidly asked whether he would approve of this, and said,
‘Oh, why not? The boys would stand on their heads if she
wished!’ The younger of the boys is a bright-coloured, cheery
lad, but the elder, on whom so much may depend, is pale, long-faced,
and I can’t help thinking, <i>for a child</i>, like Charles the
First&mdash;it is a very feeling face. At night when they were sent
to bed between 12 and 1, having been allowed to sit up as a
special privilege to the ball, the Princess said to me as they
pleaded for a little longer, ‘I do wish to keep them children as
long as I can, and they do want so to be men all at once.’
May she prevail!”</p>

<p>The mallet which was used by His Majesty on this occasion
was the one with which King Charles II. laid the foundation-stone
of St. Paul’s Cathedral. It was presented to the old
lodge of St. Paul by Sir Christopher Wren, who was a
member.</p>

<p>The King, who was of course then Duke of Cornwall, was
also present at the consecration of Truro Cathedral on 3rd
November 1887, and Archbishop Benson records an instance
of His Majesty’s religious feeling:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There was a nice incident in the consecration. Just as
the Bishop was signing the sentence of consecration, Bishop of
Salisbury whispered to me, ‘Shouldn’t the Prince of Wales be
asked to sign it?’ I sent him to Bishop of Truro to suggest
it, who sent him on to the Prince’s daïs. The Prince assented,
but instead of waiting for the parchment to be brought up,
instantly came down from his place and went up the altar steps
and signed it there on the little table set in front of the altar&mdash;a
real little bit of reverence.”</p>

<p>Another interesting ceremony was His Majesty’s consecration,
in his official capacity as Grand Master of England, of the
Chancery Bar Lodge of Freemasons in Lincoln’s Inn Hall.
The King sat in the Grand Master’s chair, wearing the full
regalia of his office; at his left sat the Earl of Lathom, Pro-Grand
Master, and at his right, the Earl of Mount-Edgcumbe,
Deputy Grand Master.</p>

<p>Many curious incidents have occurred in connection with
the King’s interest in Freemasonry. At one dinner at which
the King of Sweden was present, the list of subscriptions
announced amounted to the enormous sum of £51,000, probably
the largest amount ever raised at a festival dinner in the history
of the world.</p>

<p>On two occasions the King has presided as Grand Master
of English Freemasons over remarkable assemblies in the
Royal Albert Hall. The first was in celebration of Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Victoria’s Golden Jubilee in 1887, when the tickets for admission
produced £6000, a sum which was divided among the three
great Masonic charities. Very similar was the Diamond
Jubilee assembly of Freemasons, at which eight thousand
members were present. The King spoke admirably, the Duke
of Connaught moved the adoption of the address to Queen
Victoria, while Earl Amherst aroused unbounded enthusiasm
when he alluded to Her Majesty as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> “the daughter of a Freemason,
the mother of Freemasons, and the patron and benefactress
of our Order.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE KING AS A PHILANTHROPIST</span></h2>

<p>One of the first occasions on which King Edward and Queen
Alexandra appeared in support of a charitable institution was
on 24th June 1863, when their Majesties opened the new
buildings of the British Orphan Asylum at Slough. From
that day forward both the King and Queen have unceasingly
demonstrated their keen personal interest in every genuine
form of charitable endeavour. It would be impossible to
estimate the total sum of human misery and suffering which
has been relieved as the direct result, not only of their
Majesties’ own exertions, but also of the powerful example
which they have consistently set before the wealthy and
leisured classes. The mere catalogue of the charitable meetings
and dinners at which the King has presided would occupy
many pages of this book.</p>

<p>But His Majesty has never contented himself, as he might
so easily have done, with allowing his own subscription and
the fact of his patronage to open the purse-strings of the
charitable public. The word “genuine” has been used above
advisedly. The King has no sort of admiration for careless,
slovenly charity, which often does more harm than good.
Long ago he realised that to give money is not enough, but
that it is a sacred duty to see that the money is expended to
the best advantage and really reaches the persons for whom
it is intended. Hence it is not surprising to find that His
Majesty was from the first a strong supporter of the old
Mendicity Society, and has continued to give his countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to the Charity Organisation Society, which, in return, has been
of the greatest service to him.</p>

<p>It will readily be understood that it is not so much the
actual sums subscribed by His Majesty and his gracious
Consort to a particular charity which are valued&mdash;though the
aggregate amount which they have given away since their
marriage represents a very large sum&mdash;but it is the guarantee
afforded by the mere fact that their Majesties have subscribed
at all. Great precautions are taken to prevent a Royal subscription
from being given to a fraudulent or unworthy object,
and that is no doubt why a comparatively small sum, perhaps
only £50 or £100 from the King or Queen Alexandra,
stimulates the generosity of the public to the extent of many
thousands.</p>

<p>Charitable work, however, as those who have engaged in
it know only too well, is only a palliative. By his active interest
in the problem of the housing of the poor, which has been
described in a previous chapter, the King has endeavoured
to strike at one of the chief causes of vice and crime. We
have seen that on various occasions His Majesty has made
pointed observations regarding the provision of decent cottages
for agricultural labourers, and there can be no doubt that the
example he has set on his Sandringham estate has been of
the greatest value. The King took the earliest opportunity
after his accession, in his reply to the address presented by
the London County Council, of emphasising his interest in the
housing of urban populations also. It must not be forgotten
that the question is, at any rate in some of its aspects, a
political one, and the King has therefore been obliged to
exercise all his well-known tact and discretion in dealing
with it.</p>

<p>With regard to medical charities, the precise value of which
is fortunately not a subject of political difference, the King
has enjoyed practically a free hand. Twice in his life His
Majesty has realised in his own person the incalculable benefits
of skilled medical and surgical treatment and trained nursing,
being indeed on the first occasion literally snatched from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
jaws of death. Though the King’s active support of hospitals
dates from an earlier time in his life, these experiences
doubtless strengthened his keen desire to render the benefits
which he had himself enjoyed available for the poorest classes
of the community. Perhaps His Majesty’s interest in medical
science dates from a visit which he paid when quite a boy
to the great school, mainly for doctors’ sons, at Epsom. At
any rate there can be no doubt about the steady development
of that interest, which may be said to have culminated in
“The Prince of Wales’s Hospital Fund for London,” established
as a memorial of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.</p>

<p>Probably only those who are concerned in the practical working
of this fund have an adequate idea of the good which it has
already done and will do in the future. It is not merely, as was
erroneously supposed at first, a machine for collecting money
which might as well be sent direct to individual hospitals. No
one who appreciates the practical bent of the King’s mind
could ever have believed that he would give his name to such
a scheme as that.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea of the fund is the giving of personal
service, the money collected being used as a means of raising
the standard of work done in the various hospitals. Before the
fund existed there was no regular systematic inspection of the
London hospitals, which in consequence presented very varying
degrees of efficiency, some institutions being admirably conducted,
while in others the funds were to a greater or less
extent frittered away owing to the lack of good business
management. It never occurred to the great majority of
business men to associate themselves in the practical work of
hospital administration, though they subscribed most generously
to the hospital funds. The King’s plan was to enlist the
personal service of the most competent and representative
business men, who should form, in conjunction with certain
eminent physicians and surgeons, and a number of peers and
members of Parliament of tried ability, a visiting committee to
inspect thoroughly every London hospital. On the reports of
this committee, grants from the fund were to be made immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
or promised subject to conditions, or in extreme
cases altogether withheld.</p>

<p>The moral effect of this ingenious scheme has been extraordinary.
Not only have weak hospitals been brought into
line, but the better-managed institutions have been improved,
while as regards individuals the effect has been to encourage
every competent hospital official and to minimise as far as
possible the harm done by the incompetent. At first it was
thought that the investigations of the visiting committee, which
are necessarily extremely thorough, might be resented as inquisitorial
and un-English, but the visiting committee found
that the authorities of almost every institution were eager to
afford all possible information. The income of the fund and
the amount annually distributed show a steady increase, which
has been greatly fostered by the Order of the League of Mercy
instituted by the King in 1899. This decoration is bestowed
only as a reward for special personal service in the cause of the
hospitals. The hospital stamp, too, which brought in so much
money to the fund, was, if not actually designed, at any rate
suggested by His Majesty, the central figure being Sir Joshua
Reynolds’s “Charity,” which is to be seen in the famous
Reynolds window at New College, Oxford.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most often quoted observation ever uttered by
the King is his famous saying about preventible diseases&mdash;“If
preventible, why not prevented?” His Majesty is an eager
supporter of every properly authorised medical discovery which
promises to be of value to humanity in the alleviation of disease.
For example, both the King and Queen Alexandra have taken
the greatest interest in the “light treatment” for lupus introduced
by Dr. Finsen, a Danish <i>savant</i>, which Her Majesty had
installed at the London Hospital, and as we have seen His
Majesty experienced in his own person the value of the Röntgen
rays for purposes of diagnosis.</p>

<p>The King has long been deeply impressed with the ravages
of consumption and other forms of tuberculosis, and when,
comparatively recently, an association for the prevention of
this terrible scourge was established, he not only became its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
president, but took an active part in its deliberations. Moreover,
not long before the death of Queen Victoria he consented
to preside at a great National Congress on Tuberculosis to be
held in London in the course of 1901, and to be attended by
delegates from all parts of the British Empire.</p>

<p>As far back as 1863 the King became a patron of the
Brompton Hospital for Consumption, and in 1879 he laid
the foundation-stone of the new wing by which its accommodation
was largely increased. A few years afterwards he
showed his continued interest in the same subject by presiding
at a festival dinner in aid of the Royal Hospital for
Diseases of the Chest, in the City Road, which brought in
nearly £5000 to the funds of the hospital. Until comparatively
lately, consumption was regarded as practically incurable, and
it says much for the King’s clearheadedness and insight that
he unhesitatingly placed himself at the head of the crusade
against the disease. The historian of the future will reckon this
as not the least of the services he has rendered to his people.</p>

<p>As may be imagined from the diversity of his interests, the
King’s correspondence of late years rivalled that of Queen
Victoria, and His Majesty is always eager to acknowledge
the debt he owes to his private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys.
The correspondence is reduced by the private secretary to
three distinct sections&mdash;the private letters, the business letters,
and the miscellaneous letters. Among the latter are those
written by lunatics, begging-letter writers, and so on. The
private letters are sent up to the King unopened, the others
are all read through by Sir Francis and again subdivided, the
larger section to be replied to in a formal and official way,
the others to be submitted to the King before they are dealt
with.</p>

<p>Some of His Majesty’s correspondents evidently have a
touching belief in his power of righting wrong. They implore
him to take up their cause when they are injured, and it may
be stated that no <i>bona fida</i> epistle was ever sent to the King
without being answered, often with marvellous celerity, and
ever with the greatest courtesy and kindness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>At Sandringham there is a post office inside the house for
the use of the Royal Household, but at Marlborough House
the huge letter-bags are sent over to the St. James’s Street
post office at regular intervals throughout the day.</p>

<p>The King has long been a subscriber to the National
Telephone Company, and he is said to spend over £1000 a
year in telegrams alone, for the popular idea that Royalty’s
letters are franked, and that parcels sent by them are forwarded
free of cost, is a delusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Francis Knollys</span></p>

<p><i>From a Photograph by Russell</i></p>

</div>

<p>Sir Francis Knollys’s duties as secretary are not confined
to what are generally called secretarial duties. He has to act
as his Royal master’s supplementary memory. He keeps the
list of all the King’s engagements, and, what is a more
arduous task, arranges every item of the Royal journeys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Princess Charles of Denmark is said to have once observed
that she felt sure that if Sir Francis were suddenly awakened
in the middle of the night and asked what were the King’s
engagements eight days forward, he would immediately begin
to recite the entire list.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the position of Sir Francis Knollys is
a very responsible one, and even his most intimate friends
marvel how he can get through the enormous amount of work
he has to do. Occasionally his labours are enormously
increased, especially at times of public calamity or Royal
mourning. During the Tranby Croft case well-intentioned
folk all over the British Empire sent books and pamphlets
pointing out the evils of gambling, and in most cases these
were courteously and kindly acknowledged.</p>

<p>Sir Francis writes every important letter with his own
hand, for typewriters have, so far, never been used in Royal
correspondence. He has two assistant secretaries, who attend
to the routine work, but even then many of the letters written
by them are signed by him, and in all cases he looks them
over and sees that they are as he would wish them to be.
There is also a staff of clerks.</p>

<p>In 1865 His Majesty attended his first public dinner in his
capacity as president of the Royal Literary Fund, and ever
since he has taken the greatest interest in the unobtrusive
work done by this institution in relieving distressing cases
among those men and women of letters who have fallen on
evil days.</p>

<p>The King is a warm friend of the coffee palace movement;
in this connection it is interesting to recall the Alexandra
Trust, founded by Sir Thomas Lipton at the instance of Queen
Alexandra, for the purpose of supplying well-cooked and
nourishing food to the populace at an inclusive charge of 4½d.
It will be remembered that the King and Queen paid a surprise
visit to the Alexandra Trust Restaurant in St. Luke’s, in the
East End of London, on which occasion the various London
papers circulated the most amusingly inconsistent stories of
what their Majesties really ate. As a matter of fact they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
were satisfied with the ordinary poor man’s dinner, and were
not entertained&mdash;as was alleged&mdash;by Sir Thomas Lipton with
“chicken and champagne.” It was their Majesties’ great
desire to be treated exactly as ordinary diners. But the
Queen did break one rule&mdash;that which ordains that the metal
check, received on payment of the 4½d., should be given up
on leaving. The Queen insisted on keeping the disc, as she
said to Sir Thomas Lipton, “as a memento of a delightful
visit and a most enjoyable lunch.” Their Majesties remained for
nearly two hours; they spoke to large numbers of working men
and girls, and carefully inspected all the cooking arrangements,
and it is recorded that the King chatted with the men’s bootblack
in the basement. Sir Thomas Lipton’s comment was:
“It was deeply touching to see the men’s devotion to the
Princess; they almost worshipped her.”</p>

<p>The public are aware that, like his father, the late Prince
Consort, the King takes a keen personal interest in exhibitions
of all kinds, but it is not generally known that he himself
suggested the Fisheries Exhibition, which was visited by
2,750,000 people, and which brought in £10,000 for the families
of drowned or disabled fishermen. Altogether 16,000,000
people visited the four exhibitions over which His Majesty
presided&mdash;the Fisheries, the Healtheries, the Inventories, and
the Colinderies.</p>

<p>His Majesty has always been a great ally of the London
cabby. Although the stables at Marlborough House are
magnificently appointed, he frequently takes a hansom for his
own amusement, always over-paying the driver. For years
he has been patron of the Cabdrivers’ Benevolent Association,
the funds of which he has done much to increase.</p>

<p>The King’s exertions in the cause of public philanthropy
are so great and widespread that it might be supposed that he
would have no time for private acts of benevolence. But this
is by no means the case, and an example which is not generally
known may be given here. An officer of the Grenadier Guards,
a regiment in which the King is particularly interested, fell
into serious money troubles and had to leave the service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
ultimately becoming almost destitute. The Prince, as he then
was, heard of the case, and soon the poor ex-officer received
a letter from a firm of solicitors asking him to call on them.
He did so, and was given, to his amazement, a considerable
sum of money, together with the offer of a good appointment
abroad. The Prince’s name was not disclosed, by His Royal
Highness’s express command, but a plausible story was told of
an old comrade who wished thus anonymously to recompense
former acts of kindness.</p>

<p>Better known, perhaps, is the story of a large silver inkstand
which Queen Alexandra particularly values, though it does not
belong to her, but to the King. It bears the inscription: “To
the Prince of Wales. From one who saw him conduct a blind
beggar across the street. In memory of a kind and Christian
action.” The incident occurred in Pall Mall at a busy time of
the day, and the beggar, with his dog, was vainly trying to
cross in safety when the King, who chanced to be passing at
the moment, took the poor fellow by the arm and guided him
to the other side. A few days afterwards the inkstand arrived
at Marlborough House, with no card or letter or other clue to
the donor’s identity, which, indeed, has never been revealed to
this day.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be mentioned that His Majesty’s large-hearted
philanthropy includes even those often unfortunate
people who are expiating in prison the crimes they have committed
against society. On one occasion His Majesty visited
Portland, spent a long time in inspecting the infirmary, and
tasted the food supplied to the convicts.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KING AS A SPORTSMAN</span></h2>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>The author is indebted to an authority on sport for kindly revising this chapter.</i></p>

</div>

<p>An account of the King as a sportsman begins, appropriately
enough, with the sport of kings, though this is by no means
the only pastime with which His Majesty has identified himself.
Still, at any rate during his later years as Prince of Wales, he was
chiefly associated in the public mind with racing, and his colours&mdash;purple,
gold band, scarlet sleeves, and black velvet cap with
gold fringe&mdash;were familiar at all the principal meetings. After
his accession His Majesty leased his horses to the Duke of
Devonshire for the season of 1901, but it was understood that,
following the example of several of his predecessors, the King
intended to resume his active connection with the Turf later
on. Although His Majesty has been a member of the Jockey
Club for over thirty years, his personal interest in racing is
a matter of later growth, for it was not till July 1877 that
Queen Alexandra honoured Newmarket with her presence to
see her husband’s colours carried for the first time. On that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>occasion the King had no luck, his horse Alep, a pure-bred
Arab, which started favourite, being beaten by Lord Strathnairn’s
Arab Avowal by twenty or thirty lengths. Five years
later the King won the Household Brigade Cup at Sandown
with Fairplay.</p>

<p>The King is generally agreed to be a very good judge of a
horse. When at Newmarket he makes it a point to watch the
early morning gallops, and at one time he was very fond of
attending sales. His Majesty has also given a great impetus to
horse-breeding in the United Kingdom. Many years ago he
started a thorough-bred stud, a half-bred stud, and a shire-horse
stud&mdash;works of real public utility, which can only be
undertaken, be it remembered, by those who have wealth and
leisure, combined with intelligence and a real desire to forward
the interests of the British farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The King’s great successes on the Turf during recent years,
including two famous Derbys, have been due to the introduction
to the Sandringham stables of Perdita II., bought by Mr. John
Porter for £900. The union of this mare with St. Simon
produced Florizel II., and from that time the King’s fame
as an owner and breeder increased until it became second to
none.</p>

<p>It was in 1890 that His Majesty put his racers under John
Porter, but his total winnings were only £624. The next year,
however, the King won £4148; in 1892, £190; in 1893, £372;
in 1894, £3499; and in 1895, £8281; and in the last-named
year His Majesty’s name stood tenth in the list of winning
owners. This satisfactory result was undoubtedly greatly
owing to Lord Marcus Beresford, who was entrusted with the
management of the King’s racing stable in 1890. The King’s
horses were removed from Kingsclere to Egerton House,
Newmarket, in 1892, and since then they have been under
Marsh’s care. Persimmon was sent there as a yearling from
Sandringham in 1894.</p>

<p>The King’s most memorable triumph was his first Derby
in 1896, when Persimmon won. This fine horse is a bay by
St. Simon, and own brother to Florizel II., who was, by the
way, the first really good horse that ever carried the Royal
colours, and is the sire of several very promising animals.
Persimmon was never beaten by any horse except his own
half-brother, St. Frusquin, who twice defeated him, and Omladina,
who finished in front of him in the Middle Park Plate.
He was bred by the King and trained by Marsh at Newmarket.
He made his first appearance in the Coventry Stakes at Ascot
as a two-year-old, and, starting favourite, won the race. On
the occasion of his next appearance, in the Richmond Stakes at
Goodwood, he was again favourite, and again won by a length.
In the Middle Park Plate, though favourite, he was beaten by
St. Frusquin, but in the Derby of 1896 he beat his half-brother
by a neck. At the Newmarket First July Meeting he gave
3 lb. to St. Frusquin, and was beaten in the Princess of Wales’s
Stakes. He won the St. Leger by a length and a half; and in
the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on the 1st October he
won by two lengths from Sir Visto, the Derby winner of 1897.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>Persimmon was ridden to victory in the Derby of 1896 by
John Watts. The race was witnessed by an extraordinarily
large concourse of all classes, including a considerable number
of distinguished foreigners. Never was there a more popular
victory, and the enthusiasm all over the country was almost as
great as at Epsom. It was the fourth time in the history of the
Turf that the race had been won by a Royal owner. In 1788,
eight years after its foundation, the Prince Regent won with
Sir Thomas; and the Duke of York won with Prince Leopold
in 1816, and with Moses in 1822.</p>

<p>Altogether, in 1896, nearly £27,000 in stake money was
won by horses from the Royal stables at Newmarket. Among
the King’s notable successes in that year may be mentioned
the One Thousand Guineas, won by Thais, by St. Serf
out of Poetry, which also ran second to Canterbury Pilgrim in
the Oaks.</p>

<p>The King won the Derby again in 1900 with Diamond
Jubilee, which, like Persimmon, is by St. Simon&mdash;Perdita II.
It is an extraordinary thing for a mare to produce two Derby
winners, but that they should be by the same sire is believed
to be a record in the annals of the Turf. Perdita II. died soon
after her very promising filly Nadejda&mdash;also by St. Simon&mdash;was
foaled.</p>

<p>The Derby-Day dinner is certainly one of the most important
functions held at Marlborough House during the year, and
it is now difficult to believe that it was only inaugurated
comparatively few years ago. Something like fifty invitations
are sent out, and the guests, who are all men, are expected to
wear evening dress, not uniform. The great silver dinner-service
ordered by the King on his marriage, which cost some
£20,000, is always used on this occasion, and on the side
buffet are to be seen His Majesty’s racing cups, hunting
trophies, and gold and silver salvers, for everything in the
strong rooms which is associated with sport is brought out.</p>

<p>In addition to the Derby, Diamond Jubilee also won in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
1900 the Two Thousand Guineas, the Newmarket Stakes, the
Eclipse Stakes, and the St. Leger, and was second in the
Princess of Wales’s Stakes. Giving 12 lb. to Disguise II.,
Diamond Jubilee was unplaced in the Jockey Club Stakes.
In his five great victories Diamond Jubilee won £27,985
in stakes, and so placed the King at the head of the list of
winning owners.</p>

<p>In 1900 also the King won the Grand National with
Ambush II., and so carried off the biggest flat-race and the
biggest steeplechase&mdash;double honours which no other owner
had ever before gained, much less in the same year.</p>

<p>From the sport of kings we pass by a natural transition to
the Royal and ancient game of golf. It is well known that
golf was the favourite pastime of some of the Stuart kings of
Scotland, and Mary Queen of Scots, her son, James I. of
England, Charles I., and James II. all played. But from the
death of James II. to the accession of Edward VII. none of
our sovereigns were themselves golfers, though William IV.
and the lamented Queen Victoria gave their patronage to the
game.</p>

<p>The King learnt to play on the Musselburgh Links years
ago when he was pursuing his scientific studies at Edinburgh,
and Tom Brown, who had the honour of being His Majesty’s
caddie, still lives in hale old age. In 1863 the King became
Patron and then Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
of St. Andrews, and in 1882 he accepted the office of President
of the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club, to which the late Queen
had granted the title “Royal.” His Majesty has played several
times at Cannes and on the private links of the Grand Duke
Michael, and his love of the game is notably shared by the
Duke of Cornwall and York, the Duchess of Fife, and the
Duke of Connaught.</p>

<p>The King has lived to see the extraordinary development
of cricket, and its promotion to the rank of the typically
national game which Englishmen take with them to the ends
of the earth. We may be sure that the indirect political
influence of the great contests between England and Australia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
for example, and of the tours of Indian, South African, and
West Indian teams, did not escape his quick intelligence.
Certainly His Majesty has always supported cricket, though
he never became so keen a player as the late Prince Christian
Victor, for instance.</p>

<p>The King played at Oxford, and occasionally for I. Zingari.
In 1866, at the Park House, Sandringham, His Majesty played
against the Gentlemen of Norfolk for the Sandringham Household.
He has frequently visited Lord’s to see the Eton and
Harrow matches, and in 1899 he went there with the Duke
of Cornwall and York when the M.C.C., of which club His
Majesty is patron, played the Australians. He has also seen
the Australians play at Sheffield Park. Kennington Oval
being on the London estate of the Duchy of Cornwall, the
King, when he was Prince of Wales, was ground landlord, and
allowed the Surrey Club the use of the ground at a nominal
rental. The Surrey Club has benefited greatly through the
King’s generosity in this matter, and recently the Duchy of
Cornwall granted the club a thirty years’ lease at a very low
rent, considering the value of the property.</p>

<p>The King was for many years patron of both the Rugby
Union and the Football Association, and after his Accession
he was approached by both bodies with a view to his graciously
continuing to grant them his patronage. The game under
neither code was played much until the King had reached
middle life, but he showed his interest in the popular winter
pastime by visiting the Oval in March 1886 on the first
occasion of a charity festival organised by the Rugby Union
and Football Association.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the King owes his remarkable
bodily vigour and healthy appearance to his love of all outdoor
sports, for he was never so content as when enjoying a long
day’s tramp over the stubble at Sandringham, or when deer-stalking
in a soft Highland mist. His Majesty’s life as a
sportsman began early. When he was quite a child he used
to accompany Prince Albert on deer-stalking expeditions round
Balmoral; somewhat later he hunted with the harriers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
when he was fifteen he could claim to be the best shot in his
family.</p>

<p>Although the King has been a plucky and fearless rider
from early childhood, he has not been so fond of hunting as of
some other sports, and during the last few years he has seldom
been seen following the hounds. When an undergraduate at
Christ Church, he constantly hunted with Lord Macclesfield’s
pack, and was then considered a very hard rider; and it need
scarcely be said that the meets which take place at Sandringham
are the most popular in Norfolk, and give both the King and
Queen many opportunities of showing gracious and kindly
hospitality, both to their wealthy and to their humble neighbours.
The King is a firm friend to the hunting of the fox,
and it is understood that a pack of fox-hounds is to be established
in place of the Royal Buckhounds. In 1888 the members
of the West Norfolk Hunt presented to the King and Queen
Alexandra a beautiful silver model of a fox in full gallop as
a memorial of their Majesties’ silver wedding, and in returning
thanks the King said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I can assure you that no present which has been offered
for our acceptance has been received by us with more pleasure
than the one which you have given us to-day&mdash;a model of the
wily animal that we are all so fond of following. Norfolk has
always been considered to be a shooting county; that may be so
to a great extent, but I feel convinced that the hunting is quite
as popular, and I sincerely hope that it will long remain so.
There may be difficulties in preserving foxes, but I feel sure
that where there’s a will there’s a way. For twenty-five years
we have enjoyed hunting with the West Norfolk Hunt, both
the Princess and myself; and our children have been brought
up to follow that Hunt. I sincerely hope that for many long
years we may be able to continue to do so.”</p>

<p>Before the King had been at Sandringham six months he
made it quite clear that his country home should be in every
sense a good sporting estate, and it has been one of his chief
pleasures to entertain parties of keen sportsmen each autumn
in Norfolk. Perhaps the best shooting season Sandringham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
has ever seen was that of 1885-86. The total bag was 16,131
head, including 7252 pheasants. The best day of that season
was the last day of the year 1885, when ten guns killed
2835 head, including 1275 pheasants. The rabbit-shooting
at Sandringham is also first-rate, and it need hardly be said
that the foxes are watched over with the most tender anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King as a Sportsman in 1876</span></p>

<p><i>From an Engraving published by Henry Graves and Co.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Over ten thousand pheasants are annually reared at Sandringham,
partly by incubators and partly by the assistance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
thousand ordinary hens. The lake near Sandringham affords
wild duck, teal, and widgeon shooting. The King has the
largest game-room in the United Kingdom. It holds between
six and seven thousand head, and was built not very long after
the King bought the estate. After each day’s sport the game
is spread for inspection, and a careful record is made of the
numbers that have fallen to each gun. It is in the game-room
that the game is packed after a big <i>battue</i> to be sent off in
hampers to hospitals and to friends. It need hardly be said
that none of the King’s game is ever sold. A good deal is
kept for the use of the house, and a share is also given to the
tenants, to the <i>employés</i> on the estate, and to London tradesmen
connected with the Royal Household.</p>

<p>The King’s shooting-parties rarely number more than ten
guns, each of whom is assigned his place in the shoot by his
Royal host himself. All the beaters at Sandringham wear a
very becoming uniform composed of a Royal blue blouse, low
crowned hat, and long brown gaiters. Each bears on his left
arm a number by which he may readily be identified, and after
each day’s shooting every one of the beaters is allowed to take
home a hare and a pheasant.</p>

<p>The King is not often seen going north for the opening
weeks of the grouse-shooting season. Still, in the early years
of his married life, he and Queen Alexandra often entertained
shooting-parties at Birkhall. The King generally puts in a
certain number of days pheasant-shooting in Windsor Great
Park. The preserves swarm with ground game. His Majesty
is also fond of shooting with the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth,
and at Wynyard, Lord Londonderry’s seat in Durham.
The King has, however, shot more or less all over England.
He was frequently the guest of Lord James of Hereford when
the latter had Shoreham Place, where one valley on the farther
side of the park is locally known as “The Valley of the Shadow
of Death,” from the tremendous slaughter of game that annually
takes place there.</p>

<p>Like his father, the late Prince Consort, the King has
always been a keen deer-stalker, and when he is staying at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Balmoral most of his time is entirely devoted to this sport&mdash;in
fact, deer-stalking is what first brought him into close connection
with his present son-in-law, then the Earl of Fife, who possesses
Mar, which is one of the two largest forests in Great Britain,
being over 80,000 acres of cleared ground. Balmoral is situated
in the heart of the deer country, being within reach of a good
number of forests adjoining each other, and extending without
a break into five counties. The King is well known to prefer
“stalking” to driving, but of late years he has taken an active
part in the drives organised at Mar. His marksmanship is
universally agreed to be excellent. At one time he was owner
of Birkhall, in Glenmuick, but it was purchased for him by
Prince Albert, and he had no voice in its selection. Still the
King kept it till 1885, when he sold the property, which was
very extensive, to Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>King Edward has been extremely fortunate as a yachtsman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and probably one of the events to which he most looks
forward each year is the Regatta at Cowes. The King first
won the Queen’s Cup, annually presented to the Royal Yacht
Squadron at Cowes, in 1877, with his schooner <i>Hildegarde</i> of
198 tons. He won the Cup again in 1880 with the <i>Formosa</i>,
cutter, of 103 tons, and again in 1895 and 1897 with the famous
cutter <i>Britannia</i> of 151 tons.</p>

</div>

<p>The Royal Yacht Squadron, as is well known, was founded
as “The Yacht Club” so far back as 1815. It early enjoyed
the patronage of Royalty, among the past and present members
being numbered the Prince Regent (afterwards George IV.),
the Duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV.), Queen Victoria,
the Prince Consort, the Tsar Nicholas I., Napoleon III., the
German Emperor, and Prince Henry of Prussia. The King
became Commodore in 1882 on the death of Lord Wilton, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
he is Commodore of nine other Royal yacht clubs, as well as
President of the Yacht Racing Association.</p>

<p>The King generally takes the chair at the annual dinner of
the Squadron held at the old castle at West Cowes, built as a
fort by Henry VIII., which became the headquarters of the
club in 1858. This festivity is the great event of the year for
all well-known yachtsmen. There is an interesting display of
plate, including the Queen’s Cup, the Nelson Vase, and the
beautiful model of the <i>Speranza</i>, which once belonged to Lord
Conyngham. His Majesty presented a few years ago twenty-one
cannon to the club-house at Cowes. They were taken by
him from the <i>Royal Adelaide</i>, the toy warship placed by William
IV. to guard the artificial ocean of Virginia Water. Now they
are used for firing salutes.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the King is the owner of many
splendid prizes won at Cowes and elsewhere. Both His
Majesty and Queen Alexandra are extremely fond of the sea,
and he early made himself acquainted with the less technical
side of navigation. The King is very fond of spending a
certain number of days each year at Cannes, and when he is
there in April he generally takes an active part in the Battle
of Flowers, and he entertains large parties of his English and
foreign friends on board the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">DEATH OF QUEEN VICTORIA&mdash;THE KING’S ACCESSION</span></h2>

<p>On 19th January 1901 it was officially announced that Queen
Victoria had not been lately in her usual health, and on the
same day King Edward and Queen Alexandra arrived at
Osborne. His Majesty returned to London with his son to
meet the German Emperor, whose instant departure in the
midst of the bi-centenary celebrations of the Prussian monarchy
to the sick-bed of his venerated grandmother deeply touched
the feelings of the British people.</p>

<p>The mournful story of the days which followed is well
known. Queen Victoria passed peacefully away, at half-past
six in the evening of 22nd January, surrounded by her children
and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Then every one turned in their grief to His Majesty King
Edward VII. Hardly for a moment could he be simply the
devoted son weeping by the death-bed of his beloved and
venerated mother. He was now the ruler of a great Empire,
and bravely did His Majesty meet what must have seemed the
almost impertinent intrusion of State business and State ceremonial.
Yet it had to be done, and it may even be that, as
has been the experience of humbler mortals, the anguish of the
King’s great personal bereavement was to some extent mitigated
by the urgent necessities of action that were laid upon him.
On the following day the King held his first Council at St.
James’s Palace, when His Majesty made a declaration which
is thus described in the quaint official language of the <i>London
Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

death of My beloved Mother the Queen, and I know how
deeply you, the whole Nation, and I think I may say the whole
world, sympathise with Me in the irreparable loss we have all
sustained.</p>

<p>“‘I need hardly say that My constant endeavour will be
always to walk in Her footsteps. In undertaking the heavy
load which now devolves upon Me, I am fully determined to
be a Constitutional Sovereign in the strictest sense of the word,
and as long as there is breath in My body to work for the good
and amelioration of My people.</p>

<p>“‘I have resolved to be known by the name of Edward,
which has been borne by six of My ancestors. In doing so I
do not undervalue the name of Albert, which I inherit from My
ever to be lamented, great and wise Father, who by universal
consent is I think deservedly known by the name of Albert the
Good, and I desire that his name should stand alone.</p>

<p>“‘In conclusion, I trust to Parliament and the Nation to
support Me in the arduous duties which now devolve upon Me
by inheritance, and to which I am determined to devote My
whole strength during the remainder of My life.’</p>

<p>“Whereupon the Lords of the Council made it their humble
request to His Majesty that His Majesty’s Most Gracious
Declaration to their Lordships might be made public, which
His Majesty was pleased to Order accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty’s selection of King Edward VII. as his
“style and title” proved extremely popular, for it is an
essentially English name, and is bound up with so many
historical associations, especially with the glorious memory
of King Edward I. At the same time the King’s tribute
of filial piety to his much-loved father deeply touched
the hearts of his subjects. All over the British Empire
King Edward was proclaimed amid rejoicings which were
tempered only by a vivid sense of the common bereavement
under which His Majesty and his subjects were alike
suffering.</p>

<p>The marvellous and unprecedented outburst of sorrow for
her late Majesty, which showed that not only the British
Empire but the whole of the civilised world shared in King
Edward’s grief, undoubtedly brought His Majesty some
consolation, which was increased by the decision of the
German Emperor, who had been joined by his eldest son,
the Crown Prince, to remain for the funeral.</p>

<p>This magnificent ceremonial, in which was exemplified the
lamentation of an Empire, lasted from Friday, 1st February,
to Monday, 4th February. It was both naval and military in
character, as befitted the funeral of the Sovereign who set so
much store by her position as head of the services. The
Royal Yacht <i>Alberta</i>, bearing her precious burden, passed
from Cowes to Portsmouth along a line of warships which,
reinforced as they were by foreign vessels sent by friendly
Powers, seemed typical of the firm yet peaceful policy of the
great ruler who was being borne to her last resting-place.
The pageant through London, distinguished as it was by the
presence of four reigning Sovereigns, the German Emperor,
the King of the Belgians, the King of the Hellenes, and the
King of Portugal, as well as numerous other representatives
of foreign States, will never be forgotten by the vast crowds
who saw it pass along its appointed way. It is perhaps worthy
of mention that the Countess of Ranfurly represented New
Zealand, her husband being Governor of that Colony, and thus
the funeral of the great woman Sovereign is believed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
been the first public occasion on which a State of the Empire
has been represented by a woman.</p>

<p>The stately and yet simple dignity of the whole ceremonial
was marred by only one mishap, which is recorded here because
a number of incorrect versions of what happened were current
at the time. The funeral <i>cortège</i> did not arrive at the Great
Western Railway Station at Windsor till some time after it
was expected, the result being that the artillery horses, which
were in waiting to draw the gun-carriage bearing the coffin to
St. George’s Chapel, became chilled. Just as the procession
was about to start one of the horses on the off-side&mdash;that is,
one of those that had no rider&mdash;reared and plunged, and
eventually stood up on its hind legs. This started the next
pair, and they also began to kick, and the situation became
both dangerous and painful. So restive, in fact, were the
horses that an officer on the Staff approached the King and
received permission to remove them from the gun-carriage.
It was at this juncture that Prince Louis of Battenberg
respectfully called the attention of His Majesty to the naval
guard of honour drawn up close by, and suggested that the
seamen should draw the coffin to the chapel. The King at
once ordered that this should be done, and Prince Louis,
sending for Lieutenant Boyle, who commanded the guard of
honour, gave instructions to that effect. The traces, made
of chain covered with leather with a hook at each end, were
taken from the horses and were easily connected up by the
seamen into two long drag ropes. There was a brake on the
gun-carriage, but in descending the hill this was found to
be insufficient for the weight&mdash;upwards of two tons&mdash;and a
party of selected petty officers manned the wheels and eased
the carriage down the declivity spoke by spoke.</p>

<p>His Majesty was afterwards pleased to express his gracious
approbation of the conduct of the naval guard of honour and
their promptitude in executing his orders. Later on the King
conferred the Victorian Order on the officers, and the Victorian
medal on the men. The incident seized the imagination of
the British people, who were quick to recall other occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
on which the sea service had similarly risen to a great
emergency.</p>

<p>Few besides the members of the Royal Family were present
at the actual depositing of the remains of Queen Victoria in
the sarcophagus at Frogmore, there to sleep by the side of
her tenderly-loved husband, to whom she had addressed the
infinitely touching inscription, “Vale desideratissime! Hic
tecum requiescam, tecum demum in Christo resurgam!”</p>

<p>It was on that most solemn day that King Edward wrote
those admirable Messages to his People, to the Colonies, and
to India, which revealed to all his subjects how completely he
possesses his lamented mother’s marvellous gift of human
sympathy, combined with a full realisation of his kingly dignity.
The Messages, which are all dated from Windsor Castle, 4th
February 1901, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">To My People</span></p>

<p>“Now that the last Scene has closed in the noble and ever
glorious life of My beloved Mother, The Queen, I am anxious
to endeavour to convey to the whole Empire the extent of
the deep gratitude I feel for the heart-stirring and affectionate
tributes which are everywhere borne to Her Memory. I wish
also to express My warm recognition of those universal
expressions of what I know to be genuine and loyal sympathy
with Me and with the Royal Family in our overwhelming
sorrow. Such expressions have reached Me from all parts of
My vast Empire, while at home the sorrowful, reverent, and
sincere enthusiasm manifested in the magnificent display by
sea and land has deeply touched Me.</p>

<p>“The consciousness of this generous spirit of devotion
and loyalty among the millions of My Subjects, and of the
feeling that we are all sharing a common sorrow, has inspired
Me with courage and hope during the past most trying and
momentous days.</p>

<p>“Encouraged by the confidence of that love and trust
which the nation ever reposed in its late and fondly mourned
Sovereign, I shall earnestly strive to walk in Her Footsteps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
devoting Myself to the utmost of My powers to maintaining
and promoting the highest interests of My People, and to
the diligent and zealous fulfilment of the great and sacred
responsibilities which, through the Will of God, I am now
called to undertake.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edward, R.I.</span>”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">To My People Beyond the Seas</span></p>

<p>“The countless messages of loyal sympathy which I have
received from every part of My Dominions over the Seas
testify to the universal grief in which the whole Empire now
mourns the loss of My Beloved Mother.</p>

<p>“In the welfare and prosperity of Her subjects throughout
Greater Britain the Queen ever evinced a heartfelt interest.</p>

<p>“She saw with thankfulness the steady progress which,
under a wide extension of Self-Government, they had made
during Her Reign. She warmly appreciated their unfailing
loyalty to Her Throne and Person, and was proud to think
of those who had so nobly fought and died for the Empire’s
cause in South Africa.</p>

<p>“I have already declared that it will be My constant
endeavour to follow the great example which has been bequeathed
to Me.</p>

<p>“In these endeavours I shall have a confident trust in
the devotion and sympathy of the People and of their several
Representative Assemblies throughout My vast Colonial
Dominions.</p>

<p>“With such loyal support I will, with God’s blessing,
solemnly work for the promotion of the common welfare
and security of the great Empire over which I have now been
called to reign.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edward, R.I.</span>”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">To the Princes and People of India</span></p>

<p>“Through the lamented death of My beloved and dearly
mourned Mother, I have inherited the Throne, which has
descended to Me through a long and ancient lineage.</p>

<p>“I now desire to send My greeting to the Ruling Chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of the Native States, and to the Inhabitants of My Indian
Dominions, to assure them of My sincere goodwill and affection,
and of My heartfelt wishes for their welfare.</p>

<p>“My illustrious and lamented Predecessor was the first
Sovereign of this Country who took upon Herself the direct
Administration of the Affairs of India, and assumed the title
of Empress in token of Her closer association with the Government
of that vast country.</p>

<p>“In all matters connected with India, the Queen Empress
displayed an unvarying deep personal interest, and I am well
aware of the feeling of loyalty and affection evinced by the
millions of its people towards Her Throne and Person. This
feeling was conspicuously shown during the last year of Her
long and glorious reign by the noble and patriotic assistance
offered by the Ruling Princes in the South African War, and
by the gallant services rendered by the Native Army beyond
the limits of their own Country.</p>

<p>“It was by Her wish and with Her sanction that I visited
India and made Myself personally acquainted with the Ruling
Chiefs, the people, and the cities of that ancient and famous
Empire.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the deep impressions which I then
received, and I shall endeavour to follow the great example
of the first Queen Empress to work for the general well-being
of my Indian subjects of all ranks, and to merit, as She did,
their unfailing loyalty and affection.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edward, R. et I.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The King’s anxieties during the trying period which followed
the death of his beloved mother were much increased
by the state of health of his only surviving son. The Duke of
Cornwall and York fell ill with German measles, and, to his
lasting regret, it was absolutely impossible for him to attend
the funeral of his venerated grandmother. His Royal Highness,
however, thanks to the devoted nursing of his wife, made
steady progress towards convalescence.</p>

<p>In the midst of his own bitter grief the King displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
all his customary consideration and desire to gratify others.
Even before the funeral His Majesty found time to bestow
the Victorian Order on some officers of the late Queen’s
Guard at Osborne. To the Imperial and Royal personages
who attended the late Queen’s funeral His Majesty showed
significant marks of his gratitude. Queen Victoria had intended
some time before her death to invest the German
Crown Prince with the Order of the Garter with her own
hands, and King Edward hastened to carry out his beloved
mother’s design. The ceremony took place at Osborne, and
after the investiture the King addressed his great-nephew in
the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;In conferring on your Imperial and Royal Highness
the ancient and Most Noble Order of the Garter, which was
founded by my ancestor many centuries ago, I invest you
with the order of knighthood, not only as the heir to the
Throne of a mighty empire, but also as a near relation. It was
the wish of my beloved mother the Queen to bestow it upon
you as a mark of her favour, and I am only carrying out her
wishes, and am glad to do so to the son of my illustrious relation,
the German Emperor, to whom I wish to express my
sincere thanks for having come at a moment’s notice to this
country and assisted in tending and watching over the Queen,
and remaining with her until her last moments. I desire to
express a hope that my action in conferring upon you this
ancient Order may yet further cement and strengthen the good
feeling which exists between the two great countries, and that
we may go forward hand in hand with the high object of ensuring
peace and promoting the advance of the civilisation of
the world.”</p>

</div>

<p>The King also paid a high compliment to his nephew,
Prince Henry of Prussia, which was thus announced in the
<i>London Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Admiralty</span>, <i>5th February 1901</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
<p>“His Royal Highness Prince Albert William Henry of
Prussia, K.G., G.C.B., Vice-Admiral in the Imperial German
Navy, has been appointed Honorary Vice-Admiral in His
Majesty’s Fleet.”</p>

</div>

<p>For the German Emperor himself, who was already a
Knight of the Garter, the King had reserved a special sign
of his affection, which the <i>London Gazette</i> announced in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">War Office, Pall Mall</span>, <i>27th January 1901</i>.</p>

<p>“The King has been pleased to appoint His Majesty
William II., German Emperor, King of Prussia, K.G.,
G.C.V.O., Colonel-in-Chief 1st (Royal) Dragoons, Honorary
Admiral of the Fleet, to be a Field-Marshal in the Army, on
the occasion of the Anniversary of His Majesty’s Birthday.</p>

<p>“The Commission dated 27th January 1901.”</p>

</div>

<p>In telegrams to Lord Salisbury and Lord Roberts, announcing
that this honour had been conferred on him, His
Imperial Majesty demonstrated the great gratification which it
afforded him. Not long afterwards the German Emperor conferred
on Lord Roberts the Order of the Black Eagle, the
highest decoration in his power to bestow.</p>

<p>The honour bestowed on the King of Portugal is particularly
interesting, as it is believed to be the first instance in which a
foreign Royal personage has been appointed Colonel-in-Chief
of a line regiment. It was thus officially announced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">War Office, Pall Mall</span>, <i>19th February 1901</i>.</p>

<p class="center">“The Oxfordshire Light Infantry.</p>

<p>“His Majesty Charles I., King of Portugal and Algarves,
K.G., to be Colonel-in-Chief. Dated 20th February 1901.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of the other Royal personages who attended the funeral of
Queen Victoria, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch of
Russia, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and the
Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway were appointed
Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Prince Charles of Denmark was made an Honorary Knight
Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and an Honorary
Lieutenant in the British Navy. Prince Christian, the Duke
of Teck, Prince Louis of Battenberg, the Duke of Argyll,
and the Duke of Fife became Knights Grand Cross, and the
youthful Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, better known as
the Duke of Albany, became an Honorary Knight Grand
Cross, of the Royal Victorian Order.</p>

<p>On his accession the King became <i>ipso facto</i> head and
Sovereign of all the great orders of Knighthood, and the
position of Great Master of the Order of the Bath, to which
His Majesty had been appointed in 1897, was therefore
vacated. The King was unwilling that this interesting office,
which had been specially created by his lamented mother,
should lapse, and so he appointed his brother, the Duke of
Connaught, to succeed him in it. His Majesty also appointed
Rear-Admiral the Duke of Cornwall and York and Captain
Prince Louis of Battenberg to be his personal Naval Aides-de-Camp.</p>

<p>But unquestionably the most interesting of all the appointments
made by the King was his creation of Queen
Alexandra a Lady of the Garter. The announcement was
made by the <i>London Gazette</i> in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Marlborough House</span>,<br />
<i>12th February 1901</i>.</p>

<p>“The King, as Sovereign of the Most Noble Order of the
Garter, has been graciously pleased to command that a Special
Statute under the Seal of the Order shall be issued for conferring
upon Her Majesty The Queen the title and dignity of
a Lady of that Most Noble Order, and fully authorising Her
Majesty to wear the Insignia thereof.”</p>

</div>

<p>The wording of this intimation shows how exceptional was
the honour conferred on the gracious Queen who has long
possessed the hearts of the British people. As a matter of fact,
the distinction was without precedent for 400 years. Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Victoria, even, was never a Lady of the Garter; she was
Sovereign of the Order in her capacity as Queen regnant.</p>

<p>The State opening of Parliament by their Majesties followed
on 14th February, the national mourning being partially laid
aside for that day. The reception of the King and Queen by
the loyal crowds which lined the route to St. Stephen’s was
enthusiastic in the extreme. In the House of Lords His
Majesty delivered the Speech from the Throne in a firm, clear
voice, which only faltered a little when he came to the passage
referring to the Duke of Cornwall and York’s Colonial tour.
It was undoubtedly hard for the King to part from his much-loved
son, the only son now left to him, for so many months,
but it is not by any means the first occasion in which His
Majesty has put aside his private feelings in order to gratify
and benefit his loyal subjects.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
